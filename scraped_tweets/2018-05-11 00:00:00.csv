995090944675500040 2018-05-11 19:59:03 -0400 <SondraHarper19> @realDonaldTrump Because your on video after you took office saying you didn’t agree with the merger but you no longer wanted to litigate it. And yes that’s video with audio.

They use their License &amp; power to discredit and try to unseat a sitting president.

995090778744606721 2018-05-11 19:58:24 -0400 <RussTaylorPhD> @realDonaldTrump The question is whether your administration should be opposed to this merger. The ATT-Time Wagner deal is a vertical integration like Comcast's acquisition of NBC. Your opposition looks like an attempt to stick it to CNN and force a sale to NewsCorp.

After finding out that he cheated on Melania with other women + with lawsuits looming from those whom he allegedly abused and harassed, do they feel the same way now?
