1074453365902368768 2018-12-16 18:56:59 -0400 <NoFascism4Us> @realDonaldTrump Funny how this ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù is sending so many people to prison, don‚Äôt you think?  Oh, just hang in there for a little while longer folks.  The biggest witch the country has ever seen is gonna be sent to prison along with his adorable family.

1074453358914781185 2018-12-16 18:56:57 -0400 <SLR_mark> Rather than putting up a wall to keep the central Americans out, how about a firewall to keep the Russian hackers out? @realDonaldTrump

1074453353491398656 2018-12-16 18:56:56 -0400 <bryan_utto> @realDonaldTrump Dude, SNL is a comedy show. It‚Äôs not a news program.

Wages in California, after decades of Democrat rule, are now lower than in Alabama. Car Painter in LA $16,956 Car Painter in Birmingham Alabama $20,838 source SalaryGenius  When cost of living is factored in the difference is huge.

1074453347141185536 2018-12-16 18:56:54 -0400 <carmen1101> @realDonaldTrump Please state facts,  China's economy is not slowing due to your trade war.  The Chinese government can easily wait out your Presidency or if the Chinese are smart they cancel the $500M for the Trump Organization for the theme park.  Explain to your base how you got that money.
