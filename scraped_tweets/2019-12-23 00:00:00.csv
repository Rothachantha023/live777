1209261977157156866 2019-12-23 18:58:17 -0400 <CAMorrisInst> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi But just image all threats, bribery and extortion she wielded to get those dems voting for impeachment. Even those who are now sure to loose their seat!  That's power. Sad that she thinks any of it will work in the Senate. Do your homework Nancy...!

I know plenty of teens who drink on occasion, but they aren‚Äôt dependent on it like many vapers I know who vape. If we get people to not *start* vaping, they won‚Äôt get addicted.
