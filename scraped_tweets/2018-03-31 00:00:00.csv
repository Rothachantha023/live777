TBH, It‚Äôs a giant distraction from the crazy stuff going on. Just like over 50 Benghazi hearings and years of investigations by Republicans that produced nothing.

The only time that scumbag does anything worthwhile is if there‚Äôs something in it for him! Same with Clinton 500,000 to speak in Moscow!

Trump supporters, we need to start a prayer chain to pray the hate away. It has gripped their souls like a demonic possesion and they can't help themselves or get out of their own way. #MAGA
