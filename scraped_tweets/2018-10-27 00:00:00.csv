I knew he had a good chance of winning the presidency because of his positive attitude. Give some credit to Norman Vincent Peale, his pastor in New York who married Trump and Ivana, first wife.

What comes out of Trump's mouth everyday, are outright, provable lies. Today: Wall St. was open the day after 9/11. @realdonaldtRump #maga

1056333856004063233 2018-10-27 19:56:31 -0400 <VestigesLCRI> @oneunderscore__ The same conspiracies @realdonaldtrump and @foxnews spread. They are radicalizing right wing nuts.
1056333855752314880 2018-10-27 19:56:31 -0400 <GonzalezAcido> @julioastillero @drjoseoscarv A ver chairo pseudoperiodista, la diferencia con uno y otro es que @realDonaldTrump dijo que no vendr√° (porque le vale madres @lopezobrador_) mientras que @NicolasMaduro ya confirm√≥ que viene y con ello confirm√≥ que AMLO si nos quiere convertir en Venezuela como siempre se dijo!
1056333853994958848 2018-10-27 19:56:31 -0400 <PolitiClub1> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Trying to start a movement that's an anti movement for an ideology that is supported by half of America is not something very special.  thats dumb!
1056333850039775232 2018-10-27 19:56:30 -0400 <littlebitsnbob4> @TheRevAl The only thing shameful is you. These proud young black Americans are thinking for themselves &amp; turning away from you and your anti @realDonaldTrump rhetoric. Trump was good enough when you needed him or his $ but now you stand in judgement of him. God will judge U in the end.

1056333844100587521 2018-10-27 19:56:28 -0400 <RKJ65> Let‚Äôs run a poll @realDonaldTrump.  Which poses the greater danger to our country?
1056333842955624448 2018-10-27 19:56:28 -0400 <fupan26> Hey @realDonaldTrump it must burn your butt that Former President Obama has more likes on any subject than you do.......here‚Äôs another.   Re: Obama is eloquent, empathetic, and caring about people, where you are not.
1056333842020290560 2018-10-27 19:56:28 -0400 <KentonCJr> @realDonaldTrump I hope this doesn‚Äôt slow your momentu- Oh you‚Äôre still doing the rally instead of being the president of United States. Cool , cool...
1056333840665341952 2018-10-27 19:56:28 -0400 <BansheeAutoPart> @rjoseph7777 @realDonaldTrump Is that a ‚Äú666‚Äù on the back of his head?
1056333839499489280 2018-10-27 19:56:27 -0400 <Long11104> @realDonaldTrump Why is Trump afraid to say the words "RADICAL DOMESTIC TERRORISTS?"
1056333838442467328 2018-10-27 19:56:27 -0400 <tergeist_paul> @marybeatitude @realDonaldTrump If you remember '68, you know you were kind of a babe in the woods then, even if you were in college. We could still be shocked. We had no instant communication. We had a lot to cope with, but time to catch our breath. I'm finding this actually a more frightening time.
1056333833660981248 2018-10-27 19:56:26 -0400 <ChristFredirick> @realDonaldTrump Liars don‚Äôt go to hell anymore they got to the back of the bus
1056333832545284101 2018-10-27 19:56:26 -0400 <Diaz_OER> You know what they say, we can‚Äôt let terrorists change our way of life; makes complete sense that @realDonaldTrump goes on with his rally and he‚Äôll probably golf very soon, it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs the leader of the free world #Fool #TrumpIsADisgrace #TreeOLifeSynagogue
1056333831719059458 2018-10-27 19:56:25 -0400 <JeanaeRowley> So happy to hear from a true man and legally elected president.  @realDonaldTrump , take notes. @BarackObama , thank you for being you. Sorry you still have to pick up the slack to console Americans properly. Thank you üôèüèª

1056333830322315264 2018-10-27 19:56:25 -0400 <MoyersSonny> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You should form your own platform for tweeting. Most of your followers will leave the Twitter platform and come to your new platform. This will eliminate  the bias.
1056333829848383493 2018-10-27 19:56:25 -0400 <NathanWolaver> Time for this putz to go. LI deserves representation and class and @RepPeteKing is the @realDonaldTrump comb-over of politics.

Supposedly you're the leader of the US &amp; the free world but you're still a hate monger. Your words ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a terrible, terrible thing what‚Äôs going on with hate in our country and frankly all over the world, and something has to be done.‚Äù

1056333816552480768 2018-10-27 19:56:22 -0400 <EllenCFitch4> @2TonTonita @realDonaldTrump Any van w/ that many Trump stickers that hasn't been attacked by liberals just isn't so! It's very fishy to me! We can't wear a hat w/o being attacked.  We can't drive a car without being attacked.  I think it's a set up.

We had security with him in office. Hell, we even had security with Bush in office.
