986755369815900161 2018-04-18 19:56:27 -0400 <Marie_Onyx> @realDonaldTrump In all sincerity, can you see why *millions* of us are ashamed of your leadership? This shit is SHAMEFUL 😢 Why are you forcing millions of #US #CITIZENS to live in fear and illness? Are you trying to empty the island for a friend? #cantdenythefacts #puertorico  https://t.co/MyhnOy7UYs
