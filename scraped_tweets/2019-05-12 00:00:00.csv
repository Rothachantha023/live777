And don’t even got me started on those “beautiful” steel slats your ego thinks of as your own Great Wall, #DeranagedDonald. I think an investigation w 34 CRIMINALs indicted is already worth it.

Before that, China will have to wait for passing of 7.5 months of 2019 and major part of 2020, and that won't be easy. Your firmness on the matter which is in interest of US public will make U win the battle on tariff front.

1127725042517803008 2019-05-12 19:59:36 -0400 <nmbirmingham> @realDonaldTrump US citizens are dreaming that we have a president who didn’t start an idiotic tariff war that we can’t win and that costs US consumers billions in a new regressive tax.

1127725040525545477 2019-05-12 19:59:36 -0400 <PeytonBasil> @realDonaldTrump The importer of record absorbs the 25% so China is not paying - the US companies are then either absorbing or increasing cost  - in most cases both - it only cost China because you are bending the supply chain channels - and buyers and Mfg are looking for options outside of China
1127725039242043392 2019-05-12 19:59:36 -0400 <EJMiller707> @realDonaldTrump Several hours after your morning tweet storm? Did someone have to remind you? BTW...just a photo? Did you see Obama's tweet? Very heart felt...yours? Damn near a meme ... pathetic
1127725038445133826 2019-05-12 19:59:35 -0400 <1Tblair> @realDonaldTrump Translation .... Daddy bought my diplomas, Wharton tested  my IQs as 74,  There is no magic tariff account, so we'll borrow money from China, so I can try to buy off farmers votes in the next election. I really don't give a damn about the starving here or anywhere else.

No, of course not. Tariffs are taxes paid by the importer and passed on to consumers. What of that is so difficult to understand? Someone needs to clue in the MAGATs.

Oh, it wasn't about collusion, you thick-headed ass.  Obstruction is up front and center.  Your 'administration' is so transparent, cough up the report and other docs requested and prove it.

This can explain their deviance behavior. Yeap, you were right all this time, they are mentally ill.
