IF the House votes to impeach, the Senate will determine whether @realDonaldTrump serves out his term. It will then be up to voters who our next President will be.

1190055409291272192 2019-10-31 19:58:14 -0400 <chickflixlvr> @realDonaldTrump The republicans don't work for you. They like you, work for the people. You are a lying corrupt individual. They are not there to defend you, and if they do they should all be put out of office.

He probably met with you and conned the crap out of you! He is a Delusional Traitor who only gets by by lying and conning people.The only thing partisan is your refusal to accept that Trump is a National Security Threat

I think as the president you should be able to question a country of corruption before you give them millions of dollars of tax payers money. They should be investigating Bid on.
