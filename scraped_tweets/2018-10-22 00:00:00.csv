I mean, if they sunk, where else would the you know who's go for sexual gratification..I know that's an odd thing to say, but why else would anyone watch it? It sure isn't for info...

1054522146947547136 2018-10-22 19:57:26 -0400 <irishlghts> @realDonaldTrump Actually it's due to the fact that every time you open your mouth lies roll out.
1054522146129694721 2018-10-22 19:57:26 -0400 <DomainingDiva> @realDonaldTrump No thanks to you. You're working very hard to change that by allowing corporations to pollute at will in the name of profits

1054522144128942081 2018-10-22 19:57:25 -0400 <MarceloE68> @MSNBC In other words @BetoORourke is highly qualified and he makes @realDonaldTrump uncomfortable.
1054522143722024960 2018-10-22 19:57:25 -0400 <rebecca_stanke> @realDonaldTrump Good. They need to take care of their own
1054522143386558465 2018-10-22 19:57:25 -0400 <Party_Hamilton> @realDonaldTrump Only an idiot whines about his majority refusing to help him. Republicans hold a vote proof majority in the HOUSE. @realDonaldTrump name the bill you passed in the House... NONE
1054522142006669312 2018-10-22 19:57:25 -0400 <NYer_atheart> @realDonaldTrump So IRRESPONSIBLE of you to spread false rumors. This is not a STUPID reality show JERK....these are REAL people suffering, DYING from the effects of US intervention and the propping up of right wing corporate puppet dictators. And you call yourself "Christian"?

1054522139347480577 2018-10-22 19:57:24 -0400 <sarasbellum> @realDonaldTrump Yeah that makes so much sense. These people are fleeing violence &amp; corruption WITH aid from the US. Imagine what it will be like when you stop what little aid they get! Or is that the plan? Create "caravans" to fuel fear and rhetoric even more.  #makingamericahate
