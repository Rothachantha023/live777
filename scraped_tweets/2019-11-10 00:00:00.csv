1193679183760769024 2019-11-10 18:57:49 -0400 <HSTOZA> @tedlieu @RetiredBarack @realDonaldTrump Four Constitutional reasons for impeachment: Treason, Bribery, high Crimes, and Misdemeanors. Rather than struggle with the vagueness of "high Crimes and Misdemeanors," Congress should focus on $400 million in military aid in return for specific information. That is Bribery.

They are designed to prevent you from playing the same legal games you've played your entire career. EXTORTION is a crime. A POTUS engaged in extortion is an impeachable offense.
