1041113990049361920 2018-09-15 19:58:12 -0400 <ElisMadison> @realDonaldTrump Do you NOT get that deaths from the hurricane itself were not fully reported (phone lines down)? And in the months following the storm, Puerto Ricans went without electricity (kinda hard on folks who need oxygen), clean water (ever hear of dysentery?) etc. Where was FEMA?

1041113924828110850 2018-09-15 19:57:57 -0400 <1984JohnGalt> @realDonaldTrump Economy is not best ever. When you say ridiculous statements like that it detracts from the little you have actually accomplished. Like not screwing up the rally @BarackObama created
1041113923779534848 2018-09-15 19:57:57 -0400 <3DMacD> So, @realDonaldTrump, I have a question about the Mueller investigations.  How do you look in pin stripes? Experts: Rudy Giuliani claim that Manafort won't cooperate on Trump is bogus  https://t.co/rYCLmK4oCt

1041113909418065920 2018-09-15 19:57:53 -0400 <dontfukwitmeh> @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump It's never going to happen. Don't worry, we have no problem with you fixing the Frances that are already there but there's no way ever ( unless Mexico cuts a check to pay for it) that you'll be getting this Wall you desire!!!🤣😆🤣😂😆🤣😂🤣😆😂
1041113907824353281 2018-09-15 19:57:53 -0400 <ScuteriJennifer> @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Using exclamation points (!!) when referencing the recent deaths - which include a child, is just not Presidential.  Is solemn in his repertoire?

1041113906041839621 2018-09-15 19:57:52 -0400 <ActivistAtHeart> Thursday, America gives @realDonaldTrump the ability to send a message to all of us.  "hey, that monkey has a gun!" "yeah, but it is only a muzzle loader.  He needs an AR-15". Thanks, America.

1041113899943133184 2018-09-15 19:57:51 -0400 <eddieboyspapa> @realDonaldTrump @DannyTarkanian What about Paul Manafort, you said he was a great person. What happened. You have learned to copy and paste on these endorsements . Now learn how to pack and get ready to leave.
1041113899653849088 2018-09-15 19:57:51 -0400 <b_tcooper> @realDonaldTrump We can finish the wall when President Trump fulfills his promise to have Mexico pay for the wall! You lie and then you lie again.

That's the opposite of what is happening here in California.  Good luck.  Maybe you'd be happier in Tennessee or Alabama?

Nobody had ever hear "fake news" until you became president. Next thing we'll hear from you is how Manafort is a liar but he was a "good guy" just last week.
