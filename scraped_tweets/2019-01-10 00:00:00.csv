1083513454239961088 2019-01-10 18:58:32 -0400 <mjpwelly> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump So Obama should have used emergency powers to appoint a SC judge then.  Beyond stupid.  It will take 15 years to build a wall.  It's useless anyway.  No emergency.  No argument for a wall.  Strong argument for a  SC Senate change.

1083513453065703425 2019-01-10 18:58:32 -0400 <Dave65943553> @realDonaldTrump your right sir that 8 second clip means he obviously wanted a 30 foot concrete wall 2,000 miles long on the southern boarder! Best and least desperate president ever MAGA  https://t.co/E6OeiuT3QJ
1083513452432420864 2019-01-10 18:58:32 -0400 <SoozyQRLM> @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @Acosta Sarah, you lie almost as #TrumpCON  There IS NO CRISIS ON THE BORDER. Period. Where were the pictures of the "Humanitarian Crisis" "The Child Traffickers" "The Drug Runners" all just pouring over the borders?? If they are POURING IN, should have been able to spot just one!!
1083513451614355456 2019-01-10 18:58:32 -0400 <heterochromance> @ADaftGentleman @RepJoeKennedy @realDonaldTrump Because that‚Äôs definitely the most important thing right now.
1083513450985181185 2019-01-10 18:58:32 -0400 <jjames77743> @realDonaldTrump A challenge to pres trump: PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS OR SHUT UP. If any there is any TRUTH to your claim of "Fake News Media" I CHALLENGE YOU TO FILE SUIT. If trump does not accept my challenge he is admitting he is a LIAR. I've had enough of his communist propaganda.
1083513450670759936 2019-01-10 18:58:32 -0400 <WBellCLARITY> @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump. Comment merely a typical ploy.      Trump uses the over complement frequently, especially when sitting across from someone.      His "deals" are forged on friendly grounds, then afterwards things change.      Easier in private sector.      Harder as president.
1083513450473623552 2019-01-10 18:58:31 -0400 <EmilyWKennedy> @realDonaldTrump Federal workers are rightfully suing the govt. They also should get damages for the unnecessary stress you caused them. This will be returned to our coffers when all investigations are done and you will have to pay millions from your illegal deals.

1083513449294884870 2019-01-10 18:58:31 -0400 <JaniceGdanitz> @SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Who is paying for all of these lawyers?
1083513448431005699 2019-01-10 18:58:31 -0400 <raniero_j> @realDonaldTrump Shut up #TrumpResign
1083513448133058561 2019-01-10 18:58:31 -0400 <B1976Willie> @realDonaldTrump The art of propaganda!
1083513447772508163 2019-01-10 18:58:31 -0400 <iris5419> @CBSNews @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Trump drugs &amp; bad people as you say arrive via plane,Canada or other ports of entry. That stupid wall will not do anything. You better assure SS &amp; Medicare not affected,we worked hard for those benefits. We don‚Äôt have $ 4million given to us by our dad
1083513446715527169 2019-01-10 18:58:31 -0400 <Occularus> @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump That would be actual work for him, because he would need to feign empathy.
1083513446564548608 2019-01-10 18:58:31 -0400 <Elf1311> @realDonaldTrump Rights- we all have to rake the Forrest floors
1083513445763375104 2019-01-10 18:58:30 -0400 <SmokovCarol> @realDonaldTrump Walked out of the room like a big crybaby not getting his way. Do you even care what the majority of the country wants?  Didn't think so. Dems have passed a bill that the republicans already passed but you broke your promise. Your a liar Don the Con.
