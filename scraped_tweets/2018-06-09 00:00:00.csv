If one would be unconstitutional both would. I'm probably wasting my time responding, you don't seem like a critical thinker.
1005599934568194049 2018-06-09 19:58:02 -0400 <JahangirSartaj> My PM @JustinTrudeau is an honest, genuine &amp; a bold world leader. But, can't say the same for you; Mr. President @realDonaldTrump. Oh, by the way; Canada doesn't need a certificate from an individual, such as you who makes 3 false claims daily &amp; grabs women from their genitals.  https://t.co/oHP58Ns6Vm
1005599934261780480 2018-06-09 19:58:02 -0400 <Boondocker500> @realDonaldTrump What a fool. Can't handle someone standing up to you. Being a bully isn't working so you lash out like a child.

Trump is so damn jealous of these young leaders that he can't stand not being top dog. . The OLD man needs to remember everything has an expiration date. . .
1005599928171859968 2018-06-09 19:58:00 -0400 <Fab7555> @cnnbrk @realDonaldTrump is weak and humiliating America. He is so afraid of #Putin releasing tapes

1005599922618621952 2018-06-09 19:57:59 -0400 <GregWilliams12> @realDonaldTrump Obviously your president doesn't care about his own people suffering as trade war is now on for sure. A senseless war of his own making!
