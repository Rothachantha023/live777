1105618666987626496 2019-03-12 19:56:46 -0400 <call_me_Deeee> I think @SpeakerPelosi is setting up @realDonaldTrump to think he's in the clear to embolden him to do much more making it irrefutable that he should be impeached.@DanRather
1105618665334923264 2019-03-12 19:56:45 -0400 <Susanodonovan> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have a crime boss as a leader of your party.
1105618665318305793 2019-03-12 19:56:45 -0400 <JMattDoolan> @realDonaldTrump Sometimes when you set out on a witch-hunt you find witches.
1105618662805962752 2019-03-12 19:56:45 -0400 <Veronicaromm> Hi @HardballChris in history @realDonaldTrump will overtake Benedict Arnold and pick a dictator that‚Äôs who Trump is. He‚Äôll be remembered as a disaster. You let him on your show regularly to spew his bs so you are really a 2 faced opportunist like him. How will you be remembered?

1105618657521135619 2019-03-12 19:56:44 -0400 <24sales2U> @realDonaldTrump So now "Presidential Harassers" is a club? Can we wear vests like bikers? The name is pretty cool, it should become a movement, clubs, sub-chapters, events, this should go nationwide.
1105618656749338630 2019-03-12 19:56:43 -0400 <G37128714Rhonda> @realDonaldTrump Laugh when you make such mistakes!  We know the only one that is perfect
