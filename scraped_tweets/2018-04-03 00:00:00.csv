Amazon could easily use FedEx or set up their own delivery system ! Stop whining ! Postal services in every country have suffered due to email replacing snail mail The smart ones have embraced parcel delivery services !

The volume at which Amazon ships is nowhere near the volume at which an independent power seller ships. If you want a larger discount, up your sales significantly.

Amazon pays similar postal rates as other bulk shippers. This is a Trump attack on Jeff Bezos who owns the Washington Post which accurately covers the lies/corruption in this WH.
