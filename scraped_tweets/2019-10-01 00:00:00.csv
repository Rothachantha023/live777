1179183966244478976 2019-10-01 19:59:00 -0400 <KathyNiece> @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs not hyperbole to say that this man, commander-in-chief of our military &amp; in charge of our nuclear arsenal, is becoming more &amp; more unhinged by the day (hour?) &amp; is clearly incapable of carrying out his duties. What‚Äôs the #25thAmendment for?  https://t.co/KamXAMwDlv

1179183965875429376 2019-10-01 19:59:00 -0400 <0SweetSolace0> @realDonaldTrump Don I've been following the facts of spygate on my own too. On newsmax this afternoon I learned of the cabal within the CIA for example. Career professionals who don't carryout covert ops for example. Most of all I learned about Haspenal,whose a survivalist.
