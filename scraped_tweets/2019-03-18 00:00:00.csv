I know you're embarrassed to post Obama's because it's so dismal juxtaposed toTrump's. And that's after only 2 years! But if want to get into failures, you'll lose that one too.

1107793769766768640 2019-03-18 19:59:51 -0400 <Ellenbrown123> @realDonaldTrump Can't wait until you and your family are prosecuted for taking money and bribes from foreign leaders during your time in office.  Emoluments are only a small part, how about the billions of $$ Kushner got from the Saudis and UAE to prevent foreclosure on his 666 building.

If not, I hope you never run a business or in charge of anyone's money.
1107793530024587264 2019-03-18 19:58:54 -0400 <james_pjames> @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Would hardly call him successful.  Msybe at branding, selling his name.
1107793528674045952 2019-03-18 19:58:53 -0400 <VoiceOf38182255> @realDonaldTrump You are still making out in the end because you didn't divest. And if you really are a billionairre, how much is 400k? It would build about 20 ft of your wall, that's how little.

There is, unfortunately, hate in the world, and it comes in ALL COLORS! @realDonaldTrump is only labeled this way due to the false narrative of the propaganda media machine! Spreading lies like you and the media are doing is DANGEROUS!!!! STOP!!!
1107793522504036353 2019-03-18 19:58:52 -0400 <geoffrsh> @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Obama and Clinton did the same.  Taxpayers spent more on Obama's and Obama's family's travel than any other president in history.  $114 Million for Obama.  $10 million as of mid November 2017 for Trump (Newsweek).  Why weren't you complaining when Obama was president?

What other president has ever taken as much from we taxpayers as you have? Name just one! So, as I see it, donating your salary doesn't come close to what you cost us!!
