Taxpayers spent more on Obama's and Obama's family's travel than any other president in history.  $114 Million for Obama.  $10 million as of mid November 2017 for Trump (Newsweek).  Why weren't you complaining when Obama was president?

1107793296917696513 2019-03-18 19:57:58 -0400 <foxhunt55> @realDonaldTrump Not many have done this even when their private lives were abundantly wealthy. Some may say, he gets it back through the free marketing exposure his business receives with his position, but I say when u work all those hours &amp; work them for free that speaks volumes. COMMITMENT!
1107793294778605569 2019-03-18 19:57:57 -0400 <ruthiegirl19471> @realDonaldTrump Big deal.  You receive more than that a weekend at your hotels and you know it. You lie all the time and the worse President I have seen and since I am older than dirt,,I have seen a lot. Cannot wait until 2020 and you are gone.

1107793293893689345 2019-03-18 19:57:57 -0400 <pupspop13304> @realDonaldTrump how about you just pay for your own golf outings security...
