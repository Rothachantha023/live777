1085325643221553152 2019-01-15 18:59:32 -0400 <StumpforTrump> Now there‚Äôs a new leak that President @realDonaldTrump thought about leaving NATO, days after a leak about his meeting with Putin being private (to prevent leaks).  There should be an investigation into these National Security leaks ASAP, as they likely came from the same source.

1085325131726020609 2019-01-15 18:57:30 -0400 <dukesb12> @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You guys, (yes you - we saw you cheesing for a photo-op) go to Puerto Rico to party while these 800,000 government employees aren‚Äôt getting paid. Way to celebrate. Can‚Äôt believe you have the nerve to even tweet this. But I guess you‚Äôd have to have compassion. HYPOCRITE.
1085325128186105856 2019-01-15 18:57:29 -0400 <JANEMCG16> @realDonaldTrump I have to say, the golden candelabras were a wholly gaudy touch.  I especially like the WH's gravy boats filled with sauce packets.  In the scope of our history, not only will your treasonous acts be cited, but your tackiness is so. YOU.
1085325126957191168 2019-01-15 18:57:29 -0400 <SFerdock> @HeshmatAlavi @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump He wasn't covering anyone but the Assads ability for military abilities was his agenda. If he was concerned for the people persay he'd done it differently.He knew.
1085325126286094341 2019-01-15 18:57:29 -0400 <JOSEPHESTEVES3> @GOP @realDonaldTrump if this was true then why didn't trump make the wall issue #1.. no first he had to pay his rich friends with tax breaks...now he wants to pay his racist friends with a wall  NEVER A WALL
1085325125656952832 2019-01-15 18:57:28 -0400 <maigilie> @realDonaldTrump Don't back down, pull out from Afghanistan and Iraq.
1085325124507746305 2019-01-15 18:57:28 -0400 <DaveGander> @OnerousNous @PrasunK5 @realDonaldTrump Right you want to waste time on the semantics of English Grammar bring it on. Just remember as a nation you can't even spell English words correctly let alone form sentences.  On the whole you have a use of English up with which I shall not put. Onerous "We" says it all really
1085325124285407232 2019-01-15 18:57:28 -0400 <Taurean422> @pattty_k @realDonaldTrump BTW, "Just Say No" doesn't work. üòÖ
1085325123458977792 2019-01-15 18:57:28 -0400 <jeffmoore64pub> @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump Our that's right, lets leave Syria immediately creating a power vacuum which helps prop up Assad and allow more to be murdered.  Look in the mirror you fool!!

1085325119701090312 2019-01-15 18:57:27 -0400 <andyblandina> @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Then I suggest you get your unamerican and illegal alien loven ass back to Washington and do what we tell you to fund the wall take out the 54 billion Nancy seemed to find more to give to other countries and build it with that
1085325119273267201 2019-01-15 18:57:27 -0400 <weiner_beth> @realDonaldTrump Your military leaders have no respect for you despite your photo op. If you really cared about security, then pay your Coast Guard and Border Patrol. And not in hamberdlers.
1085325118363000832 2019-01-15 18:57:27 -0400 <wahtx> @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm sorry but you are delusional if you think a shutdown is anyway good for the American people.

Democrats have negotiated AND offered border security $$ just not to put towards a wall because the citizens of America that they represent with their votes do NOT want the dumb ass wall. You act like they randomly vote no... they vote no for US - bulliesüñï  https://t.co/aq9SnmoX9y
