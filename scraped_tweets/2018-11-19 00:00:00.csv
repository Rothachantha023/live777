1064669549054836737 2018-11-19 18:59:35 -0400 <SeriousSwill> @GOP @realDonaldTrump Worth noting your standard bearer, Little Tiny Hands, dodged the draft not once, not twice, not three times...but FIVE EFFIN' TIMES! While McCain was tortured at the Hanoi Hilton and Bob Mueller was slogging around South Vietnam, Donald was partying in Manhattan.   Hardly a hero.

Even though Josh is a right-winger, he thinks Trump has been handling things is wrong. Instead of just sending troops, Josh wants Trump to focus on taking care of the less fortunate. Just like how Josh thinks Trump should do a better job of taking care of them in California.
1064669546005651458 2018-11-19 18:59:35 -0400 <DiogenesLamp0> @BethNickel2 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Was it right for Trump to attack &amp; humiliate Bill's accusers? Hillary never did that, at least not publicly. And BTW, liberals never liked Trump, ever. He was mocked by Doonesbury in the 80's and by The Simpsons in the 90's. Trump is the villain in "Back to the Future."
