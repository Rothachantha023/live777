1120114981326901249 2019-04-21 19:59:56 -0400 <AgentKristineP> @realDonaldTrump But you may have obstructed justice in the process. Rookie mistake genius. üôÑüôÑü§• Clinton also was innocent in White Water but lied under oath and THAT was his undoing. #historyrepeats you just signed your #impeachment articles. You can‚Äôt run the Oval Office like a company

1120114978579595264 2019-04-21 19:59:56 -0400 <CestMoiChantal> @realDonaldTrump Russian interference was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. Your administration‚Äôs numerous ties to how that played out is detailed in Mueller‚Äôs Report, but apparently COLLUSION is not actually a crime, albeit despicable and possibly treasonous!

Something must be true in the report or you would not have such a defensive political strategy to divert attention from the obstruction part of the report.

Then again, we're talking about you, so we shouldn't get our hopes up. Maybe just resign now rather than face impeachment. Look at it this way, you'll have more time to get ready for jail.
