988929195316301824 2018-04-24 19:54:28 -0400 <iloveFL2017> I realized that @realDonaldTrump is having a rally in Michigan on Saturday. If he visits Mar-a-lago, it will probably be Sunday and Monday, or even a Friday/Sunday/Monday trip.

988929181907148800 2018-04-24 19:54:25 -0400 <NikkisBubble> @realDonaldTrump kissed, hugged and held  Macron's hand today more than we've ever seen him do with @flotus Melania. Well she's always saying him away so... #Hardball #inners
