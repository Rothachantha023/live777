The very fact that the economy began to grow and rebound is thanks to him.  The current numbers are a logical geometric progression trending on an upward trajectory.

When the press reports a story, it isn't fake news just because you don't like it. It has to be intentionally made up and told as fact.

Other side: Notes and repeats reality to advance agenda of saving lives &amp; centering human well-being.  This isn't "both sides."
1033866027426344962 2018-08-26 19:57:23 -0400 <stephen_housman> @realDonaldTrump @WashTimes Here is some evidence to show you that Obama improved the economy better than you up to this point (stock market). Please take note that the vertical column is the percentage gain and both presidents start at 100% at ingratiation day.  https://t.co/HEFMtzOAFH

You should go back to whatever fever swamp you emerged from. You won’t sound crazy there.  https://t.co/mpGoMY7mfX
1033866020220485632 2018-08-26 19:57:22 -0400 <Suebiking> @realDonaldTrump @WashTimes Trump media tries to rewrite history to credit Trump for Obama accomplishments. O inherited the worst recession since the Great Depression but on his watch the unemployment rate dropped 50%, GDP growth topped 4% several times &amp; stock market grew at a faster rate than under you.

1033866000452792320 2018-08-26 19:57:17 -0400 <erikoost> @realDonaldTrump @WashTimes Just like the number of people during inauguration?   “Most people ever”.....?

1033865997256675328 2018-08-26 19:57:16 -0400 <EdwardHBOh> What @realDonaldTrump did - or rather failed to do - is one of the most fundamentally un-American acts ever committed by a POTUS. This most unmanly of men is who 90% of my fellow Republicans seek to celebrate and rationalize?

The left wing thinks that they can destroy Donald Trump by lying about economic statistics. They can't. . People that haven't worked in years have found employment. People are getting larger paychecks people paying less taxes.
1033865992823341057 2018-08-26 19:57:15 -0400 <onetermcongress> @realDonaldTrump @WashTimes Yeah.....he almost TRIPPLED the stock market with NO HELP from the party of NO....glad your coat tales could follow his great economy.
1033865992244486144 2018-08-26 19:57:15 -0400 <kmm1801> @MCJeffry @realDonaldTrump @WashTimes Obama spent overspent $10 trillion. He gave out $2.5 trillion to bail out large corporation's no oversight. How many citizens got debt relief from bank bail outs. How many home owners mortgages were assisted by realestate bail out. Using our money to bail corp not economic gain.

Thirdly, facts are easily proven, so stop lying. Lastly, just shut the fuck up and go away. No one wants to hear from you. @PressSec @WhiteHouse @GOP #ResignTrump
