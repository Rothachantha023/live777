981682218019053573 2018-04-04 19:57:34 -0400 <Johnrigsby128> @realDonaldTrump That "wasted" procedure involves determining if they are refugees and if just sending them back would result in their deaths.  That's not a waste.  We are America and we are better than this.

Trump just seems a little too much like someone doing what he's been instructed to do.

Flipping the bird basically means "You suck &amp; I don't like you." Which is not a legally actionable sentiment.

"I voted for a Great White Shark and he bit me, how could this have happened?!"
981682078269009920 2018-04-04 19:57:00 -0400 <Tmeyer9> @funder @realDonaldTrump Your rhetoric is comical. Obama will go down as one of worst ‚Äúby a landslide‚Äù. Zero proof that there was collusion, ZERO. Supposedly cheated on wife SUPPOSEDLY. 12 years ago. Obama cheated America and Americans for 8 years

Little difference in Trump/Romney/McCain vote totals in those states. BIG DIFFERENCE in Hillary/Obama votes... Would have won election.

They believed in US and the power we have as "We the people..." to make that a reality
