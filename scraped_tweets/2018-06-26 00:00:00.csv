1011761016693231622 2018-06-26 19:59:58 -0400 <NotpcT> @Technologyoffe4 @realDonaldTrump I approve of how he is handling it, but seems like it would make more sense to only take a couple on at a time.  I think China was a good choice.  He has a lot of people working it and there are many moving parts, so it will be really impressive when he pulls it off.

1011760327812435968 2018-06-26 19:57:14 -0400 <LezlieEileen> @mattmfm Does someone want to inform this woman and other @realDonaldTrump supporters there are white folks who are rapists and drug dealers? Oh, and most mass killers in the US aren't people of color. Criminal behavior is not exclusive to any particular race.
1011760327707504641 2018-06-26 19:57:14 -0400 <VStewartNYC> @DailyCaller @realDonaldTrump Tender moment?  The only tender moment DJT ever has is when he fantasizes about his daughter.
1011760327023824896 2018-06-26 19:57:14 -0400 <james_rockola> I don't understand how Republicans can say @realDonaldTrump is a good businessman and he knows what he's doing. He went bankrupt 6 times, 7 if you count the US economy. His charity foundation is a joke and his college was a scam. You're kidding yourselves.

Hey jackass, I mean Trump, why don't you ban your buddies from Saudi Arabia from coming here to Us while you're at it. I do believe most of the people responsible for 9/11 were from there. There's you an idea
