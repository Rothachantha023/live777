In a nutshell, it's regarding Pierre's use of the war measures act during the October Crisis in the 70's. How he used it as political theater to lock up an election, garner gov't support, and vilify political opposition. Lots more there, but you get my point.

However, final adoption into both of these organizations isn't scheduled before Feb of 2019. Both organizations can pull out if Ukraine is involved in military conflict.

Most of you wouldn't be here.  Migration is a natural and necesary move, even an obligation, when comes to survive and protect your family.

That‚Äôs staggering compared to the $20,000 an hour it costs for a commercial airline.  President Trump‚Äôs traveling costs were $10 million his first month in office.
