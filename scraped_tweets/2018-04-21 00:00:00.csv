987843374211305472 2018-04-21 19:59:48 -0400 <vharrelle71> @PervasiveTruth @realDonaldTrump SC Mueller cautioned about media accounts of details of his investigation.  The shock to public white knight expectations may be great  when Mueller is done. Many are based on assumptions by those who actually know nothing of  a closed investigation.

The DNC and Obama's Administration corruptly colluding with Russia.

987843155444748288 2018-04-21 19:58:56 -0400 <Billhanlon8651> @maporterwriter @realDonaldTrump Thank you for your reply.  I am addicted to POTUS. I see the good in this man and while his flaws dominate the press it doesn’t seem like a lot of good things are being shown. Flaws many but, I voted for a business man in stead of a politician. No regrets.
