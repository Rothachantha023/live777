1067567945524621312 2018-11-27 18:56:47 -0400 <RN4Truth> @realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza @GM In 10 years the price of a suburban went from $30,000 to over $70,000!  How does that happen ?
1067567945025495040 2018-11-27 18:56:47 -0400 <Mallorymillett1> @ttyllord @Shotgun_pi @KennethRYoung1 @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Stop rationalizing for hoodlums, marauders, invaders. They have no right to assault us as we live our lives in OUR HOME. We have A DUTY to turn them away as they attempt to break in and enter OUR HOME. It‚Äôs no more OK to assault our land as it would be to assault your house.

1067567938646024192 2018-11-27 18:56:45 -0400 <SyimonTemplar> @The_UnSilent_ @realDonaldTrump As soon as he made that statement in 2016, the IC lit up like a Christmas tree. He is regretting that he did now BIGLY!!
1067567938331381760 2018-11-27 18:56:45 -0400 <sammy081989> @realDonaldTrump I don't understand why mueller is still continuing to work . He took the position knowing he was violating the laws as special counsel knowing rosenstin personally etc. When will someone file charges against him and get him out or is he there till 2020.
1067567937635188737 2018-11-27 18:56:45 -0400 <katywh20> @Defeat_Trump2 @NancySinatra @JohnBadger41 @realDonaldTrump We don't *do* anything with Bernie Sanders we wait and see how this plays out. Democrats have been embracing most of what he stands for.
1067567937337192448 2018-11-27 18:56:45 -0400 <quantumscribe> @realDonaldTrump You know, it's said that laughter is the best medicine. But if you don't stop these incredibly funny and outrageous statements, I'm going to be seriously over medicated very soon. #SeemsLotsOfWitchesAreBeingJailed #GuiltyPleasTendToRuinACrooksLife
1067567935160487936 2018-11-27 18:56:44 -0400 <318lizardking> @realDonaldTrump Have you ever read ‚ÄúThe Art of War‚Äù?
1067567934770479105 2018-11-27 18:56:44 -0400 <IdaGreyBenden> @jdice03 @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump avoided the draft five times; I doubt he can spell volunteer
1067567933516324865 2018-11-27 18:56:44 -0400 <nousgnostic> Hey @POTUS , @realDonaldTrump  it‚Äôs time to defund the UN...
1067567932639719425 2018-11-27 18:56:44 -0400 <Joan1Barb> @ErikJensen16 @wvufanagent99a @ImabitcSumtimes @coistyloyal @realDonaldTrump @GM I listen to Rush but he didn't really name these players. He doesn't talk about the occult &amp; child sex trafficking. There is a lot of corruption.
1067567930588590080 2018-11-27 18:56:43 -0400 <applefan333> @realDonaldTrump @GM TELL MARY BARRA TO BRING BACT HUMMER, MOST AWESOME SUV - IT WILL BE A BEST SELLER WORLDWIDE. The world craves SUVs. The most unlikely candidates are pushing SUVs that are largely AWFUL.  GM KILLED HUMMER for the bailout.  BRING HUMMER BACK, IT WILL DOMINATE!  https://t.co/NQAF4bso9x

1067567927279394816 2018-11-27 18:56:42 -0400 <debraak> @besslevin @EddyElfenbein Is that the gut feeling that got @realDonaldTrump bankrupted four times?
1067567926075695104 2018-11-27 18:56:42 -0400 <MVSNoticias> El presidente de los EEUU, @realDonaldTrump amenaz√≥ en cancelar la reuni√≥n del G20 en Argentina por crisis mar√≠tima entre Mosc√∫ y Ucrania.  https://t.co/cd3os7Mijq

1067567920593674240 2018-11-27 18:56:41 -0400 <LadyLiberty1791> Mr. President, I agree with Michelle @michellemalkin Why hasn't an official state of emergency at the border been declared yet?  It's time. @realDonaldTrump
1067567920358801408 2018-11-27 18:56:41 -0400 <Reigart> @realDonaldTrump Trump protects American workers?  Ha!  Look at soybean farmers, Carrier workers, and GM workers who will lose their jobs. to name just a few.  They suffer because of Trump's stupidity.  Feeling conned yet, Trump supporters?
1067567920161701889 2018-11-27 18:56:41 -0400 <AllenWMcCall> It seems that this President @realDonaldTrump bashing is for many Hollywood celebrities like the ‚Äúice bucket‚Äù challenge was for working-class families (i.e., you‚Äôre nobody if you don‚Äôt do it) So to all you that have joined in, I want to wish you a Merry ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù Christmas!
1067567918924218368 2018-11-27 18:56:40 -0400 <dkdkwoods> John Bolton is the fucking US National Security Advisor to the president and has chosen not to listen to the recording regarding the Kashoggi murder.  I guess he doesn't think this might be a matter of U.S. National Security.  He should find another job. @realDonaldTrump
