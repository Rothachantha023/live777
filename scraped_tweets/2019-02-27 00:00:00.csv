You are saying that you're choosing a dictator known to oppress its people over the South Korean democracy, because you would like to turn them into an economic "powerhouse". We don't rely on them, so why do you want us to start relying on them? Oh yeah...  https://t.co/k74NZB5SOn

But do not tell me that Trump does not lie it has been proven time and time again that I guess we'll agree to disagree on too

1100908221827559429 2019-02-27 18:59:08 -0400 <ctboco> @AliVelshi @realDonaldTrump will never care the substance of the agreements. All he wants is a world stage where he can say that he negotiated. Maybe he will keep on asking for the coveted Peace prize.
1100908219222904833 2019-02-27 18:59:08 -0400 <LashDeb1> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Yes, sounds like he he did indeed lie. Not only about his personal finances, but also to protect you and your business.  Why did you work with and pay him for some 10 years Mr. President?  He’s going to jail. And you?
1100908217440354305 2019-02-27 18:59:07 -0400 <1burnman> The question now is what are we going to do about @realDonaldTrump Trump's criminality
1100908216802791425 2019-02-27 18:59:07 -0400 <CuteNLivin4God> @realDonaldTrump Should be some HIPAA violations for a lawyer to testify against a client, ex or o's  That's weird 🤨🙂  Heavenly Father FORGIVE us all please.

1100907986329821184 2019-02-27 18:58:12 -0400 <Solvseus> @MarcoGutierrez @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump You think Trump, the personification of every single one of the 7 mortal sins and everything Jesus spoke out against, is the good guy? Really? Wow. Just read his Tweets. His own words. That is not a good person. Cohen is going to jail because he lied FOR him. You get that, right?
1100907986027855872 2019-02-27 18:58:12 -0400 <makebase> .@realDonaldTrump in the near future: #MichaelCohen? I'm not sure I've even met him. Wouldn't recognize him if I swam past his concrete-laden corpse in the East River. Are you sure he worked for me? I don't remember hiring any Jews.

So you're lying Cohen. Meanwhile, Cohen had spent 10 years with Trump personally and personally. I think he knows him a little better
