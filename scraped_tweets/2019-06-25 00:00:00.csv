1143669204014395392 2019-06-25 19:56:01 -0400 <acmecoyote2002> @DanCrenshawTX The trillion $ tax break given to the top 1% was suppose to make the Treasyry flush with cash and increase the middle class. Too bad it was a fraud now the middle class is stuck with school loans and no job. @realDonaldTrump is a liar and GOP house/sen hold his coat tails

That‚Äôs why he refuses to answer questions from anyone who doesn‚Äôt kiss his butt. He can‚Äôt handle the real questions. He is a bully - barks loud to thwart them off because he can‚Äôt handle@being confronted with the truth.
1143669188193423360 2019-06-25 19:55:57 -0400 <ladysflare6594g> @realDonaldTrump Mr Pres, veto the bill proposed by Pelosi. Americans don't want you to sign this abomination. We don't want to pay for illegal aliens we want them removed, not supported. Thx. Keep up the good work, sir.

I used to watch FOX sometimes...knew they were conservative, but figured I could ‚Äúfilter‚Äù the spin. Geraldo was the 1st one to say something I knew to be false, then repeat it four or five times deliberately I quit FOX thanks to him.
