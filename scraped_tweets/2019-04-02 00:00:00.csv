1113229110912913409 2019-04-02 19:57:57 -0400 <Donchump2020> @realDonaldTrump does this because he can‚Äôt lead. And an interesting byproduct is that he is able to place blame on someone else when things inevitably go wrong. What is sad is that congress can‚Äôt come together and do what‚Äôs right. Regardless of party.

They are nothing but armchair quarterbacks-bitching about everything, yet never have anything constructive to offer. They can't think of anything to do but investigate instead of legislate. They're a waste of our tax dollars.
