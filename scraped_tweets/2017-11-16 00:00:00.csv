931309953343614976 2017-11-16 18:56:10 -0400 <ScooterTrash10> @realDonaldTrump Gonna borrow money from China and jack up the debt so you can put your name on something that throws a few scraps down while you profit. Sounds familiar.. Except America can't just file for  bankruptcy like an Atlantic City casino...
931309952244830208 2017-11-16 18:56:10 -0400 <tabsterKc> @nytimes Can we say "told you so?" @realDonaldTrump.  Nice.

The public IS judge and jury in the court of public opinion. #investigation
931309943336128513 2017-11-16 18:56:08 -0400 <kiki_mou> This is just disgusting. SHAME ON YOU @realDonaldTrump!! SHAME ON YOU @TransCanada!! You were warned but had no regard for the safety and well-being of other people or the beautiful plains you were so eager to destroy.  https://t.co/wuWax9ElW5

So, yes, he is accused. But Weinstein did not admit his wrongdoing until he was forced to save himself and after he was fired. Where was all this weinstein support then? And still no trial. Moore is not different.

Trying to sell that if we give all this money to Corporations they will invest the way he wants them to with no guarantee written in legislation that they need to. Hopefully the Senate will lay out X,Y and Z to get #TaxCuts
