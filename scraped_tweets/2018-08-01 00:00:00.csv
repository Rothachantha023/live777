Don't deviate into petty fights with democrats and don't open new flanks of attack to them. Like you did in the campaign. A great economy should be advertised, not hidden under trivial things.

1024806174951071745 2018-08-01 19:56:46 -0400 <rickrecordist> @realDonaldTrump Trump's links to Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Oleg Deripaska, “Fat Tony” Salerno, boss of the Genovese crime family, and Paul Castellano, boss of the Gambino family. All go WAY back to the 80s in mob-backed construction projects, Trump’s Plaza included.   https://t.co/3AQBwOyM0u

1024806167556411392 2018-08-01 19:56:44 -0400 <kelliwardaz> In Washington, I’ll be a true problem solver who will work together with @realDonaldTrump to move forward the #AmericaFirst agenda. My policy passions are #BuildTheWall, #RepealObamacare, grow our #economy, end wasteful spending, &amp; take care of our veterans! #AZSEN #VoteWard  https://t.co/o0i3ogooJg

1024806161894330369 2018-08-01 19:56:43 -0400 <Serge_de_la_Rey> @realDonaldTrump So @realDonaldTrump aka @POTUS now officially admits that #TrumpConspired ! #ImpeachTrumpNow
1024806158266245121 2018-08-01 19:56:42 -0400 <amymeansjustice> @realDonaldTrump You're giving me a flashback to how nervous Rudy sounded on Cuomo last week......and then he cracked up, and remains a hysterical loose cannon.   Btw, Sessions can't help you.. don't you know that?  Just resign already.
1024806157943300097 2018-08-01 19:56:42 -0400 <OrlandoCentrist> @AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump Pastor and Trump must have adultery in common. Or maybe misogyny. Or maybe Pastor skips church and plays golf on Sunday morning.
1024806157175676928 2018-08-01 19:56:42 -0400 <Berenda001> @ScottFrazier19 maybe you should quit your day job and consider being a comedian @realDonaldTrump

1024806146224271361 2018-08-01 19:56:39 -0400 <brianwalston> @CarolLeonnig @JudiGatson @realDonaldTrump Why would any question that relates to ANY illegal activity be off limits. Defies common sense. If it's within the statute of limitations, it oughta be fair game. President or not, he's still accountable.

To b specific. When networks make mistakes they correct them publicly. Trump won't say b/c he knows Networks are correct otherwise he could sue them for libel.
