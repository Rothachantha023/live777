Please tell me how CPS proved that 2 of my grandkids were sexually abused by their dad. Both at 5. grand daughter report says he raped her several times over yr. Steuben County IN won't prosecute. Justice for kids?

America has demanded sitting Presidents and leaders of countries to be brought to justice for their crimes. Isn‚Äôt that hypocritical.
