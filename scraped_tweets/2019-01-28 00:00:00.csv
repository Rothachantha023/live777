1090036801002180608 2019-01-28 18:59:59 -0400 <GitSmarmy> @realDonaldTrump Mr Trump, I applaud this initiative, but before tackling biblical literacy shouldn’t you first take a step back and try and address basic literacy? For example, how to spell “tap” and “hamburgers”. That would be a good start.

The US electorate wanted to try a new hand after 8 years of Obama. But this hand is a bust. Now is past time to fold on the MAGAGOP.

1090036527034523648 2019-01-28 18:58:54 -0400 <Kellyring> @AOC So there are more than 50% of  population that doesn’t pay taxes but yet those of us that do work are expected to pay more. Why not create opportunities to work (like @realDonaldTrump ) instead of offering handouts like left loves to give. Give hope not handouts

Otherwise why would you make racial insults like calling Sen. Warren Pocahontas and all of the other insulting nicknames? Calling yourself a counterpuncher doesn’t cut it.

The sooner it ends, the sooner the extent of your criminal activity is know. The sooner Mueller's investigation ends, the sooner your "presidency" ends.  Then come the state charges. #Impeach

1090036294820999168 2019-01-28 18:57:59 -0400 <MathGuySeven> @Martina @realDonaldTrump Its a vague statement meant to pander to his following. They get excited because anything that Trump said is assumed true and nothing anyone else says to refute his claims is considered valid. Until I get a list of states, I’d never engage in a discussion on my thoughts on this.

It will NOT go back in the bag! It WILL be war now. That's exactly how bad "Obama the terrorist" hates the USA, How bad Soros hates the USA, how treasonous our Congress truly is. They are well aware of what Islam is. They think they have a deal with the OIC/UN. THEY ARE WRONG

1090036038607818758 2019-01-28 18:56:58 -0400 <RealSobotka> @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Isn’t the first Tuesday of the month GOP reminder day when he calls each compromised Senator to remind them what Putin has on them from their hacked emails in 2016 and to behave and follow the Sultan of Sexual Assault
1090036038234505216 2019-01-28 18:56:58 -0400 <kvignau> @realDonaldTrump Donald, you don’t even realize there’s a thing called “ separation of church and state.” Get a clue.
