1051985530122948609 2018-10-15 19:57:49 -0400 <clivebushjd> @realDonaldTrump Thank You President Trump. Lower-priced Medicare Advantage plans is SO important. Bernie and the Democrats, I think, thought people were just going to die earlier with their insurance plans; they seemed not to care about anyone that needs these lower prices. Cordially Sir, #MAGA
