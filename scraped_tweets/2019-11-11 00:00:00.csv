1194041867056365569 2019-11-11 18:58:59 -0400 <AmandiBelonwu> The impeachment is naked injustice against @realDonaldTrump
1194041866913640448 2019-11-11 18:58:59 -0400 <DonWorthDrums> @realDonaldTrump You really don‚Äôt understand how impeachment proceedings work do you. Maybe one of your staffers will give you a coloring book on how it works.
1194041866532077568 2019-11-11 18:58:59 -0400 <jacktsnack> @Rockprincess818 @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump @greggutfeld @FoxNews GOP needs to get their candidates in order NOW with several not seeking reelection. Can't take 2020 for granted just because of this impeachment nonsense.

1194041865542262789 2019-11-11 18:58:59 -0400 <PHL_BirdsFlyers> @aiksmart @MsTucson13 @mmpadellan @TrumpWarRoom @realDonaldTrump ...also, notice anything else in particular about the chart? Manufacturing jobs nosedived under GWB2. Last I checked he was a Republican. In recessions, manufacturing jobs plummet. Obama made the best of a bad hand he was dealt. A smooth, steady hand at the controls does wonders.

1194041863411363840 2019-11-11 18:58:59 -0400 <EricaDoering> @realDonaldTrump @greggutfeld @FoxNews So now it‚Äôs our fault you attempted to withhold aide to a foreign country unless they agreed to dig up dirt on your political opponent while you were for running for president? Lol, good one! I bet it‚Äôs us who‚Äôs shitting your pants now too!
1194041863357042689 2019-11-11 18:58:59 -0400 <CTRiti> @realDonaldTrump A transparent pres would release an actual transcript, not a memo.  A transparent pres would let his staff hold daily press briefings.  A transparent pres would not sue to hide his taxes after promising to release them.  The only thing transparent about you is your hair.
1194041863251955713 2019-11-11 18:58:59 -0400 <aarjjf> @realDonaldTrump @greggutfeld @FoxNews Overestimating their skills is a common trap for a con man like Trump. Many aren't even cognizant of their impending disintegration. See ya Oogie Boogie Man.

1194041858428678144 2019-11-11 18:58:57 -0400 <luv2birdie> @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump I do.
1194041857908596736 2019-11-11 18:58:57 -0400 <VotedHimOut> @realDonaldTrump You really should educate yourself on how these proceedings are supposed to work.  Maybe if you had done a little research, you would have known that Quid Pro Quo is against the law.  Nothing like learning the ins and outs of your job too late.  #liarinchief #traitorinchief
1194041857732435968 2019-11-11 18:58:57 -0400 <Sml2town11> @realDonaldTrump Are you releasing your tax returns?  Are you allowing people in your administration to testify?  Are you releasing the secret server?  The only thing transparent about you is your lawlessness and desperation.  #Resign
1194041857711443968 2019-11-11 18:58:57 -0400 <Lovelylane120> @realDonaldTrump The only thing I‚Äôd fine tantalizing is you not being president anymore.

1194041857157804033 2019-11-11 18:58:57 -0400 <LogicIntegrity> @realDonaldTrump Why does the first call "therefore" have to be the most important? That makes no sense. Kinda like you don't make sense. "Something."
1194041856960716800 2019-11-11 18:58:57 -0400 <Dreamweasel> @everSoTweetly4u @realDonaldTrump @greggutfeld @FoxNews I do not expect I will change your mind today, but I do appreciate your answering the question.  Perhaps his consistent habit of lying about every single thing that might make him look bad might cause you to reconsider where you have placed your faith.  https://t.co/A7Vl8jMCjT
