It shows you are mentally removed from reality, and yourself.  I cannot say whether or not you are removed from yourself, but you absolutely are removed from reality.  You are not normal.  You are sub normal.

You dishonor the office. As to the Russia investigation 22 indictments, 6 guilty pleas indicate that it is very real.  Your administration, however, is scandal filled.
