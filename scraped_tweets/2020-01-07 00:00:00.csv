1215060237096452097 2020-01-08 18:58:29 -0400 <telekinetica> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Point is, Iran has never had the chance to develop as a modern country by their own accord for over 100 years, because of greed &amp; religious-imperialism. This pushed them towards paranoia &amp; hardliners. The Iranian/Persian culture should be left alone to pursue their own future.
