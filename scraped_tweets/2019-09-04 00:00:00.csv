1169399582813491200 2019-09-04 19:59:21 -0400 <Canoe747> @realDonaldTrump This is Trump pretending to care. It's election time and he doesn't want to be remembered for failing Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. But he failed them and we won't forget.  He is so uneducated and uninformed. I look forward to getting a real president in 2020.

THIS is why he's so dangerous and he can do so much damage until Jan 21!    Not to mention his 'pardon power' for criminals who are on his side!
