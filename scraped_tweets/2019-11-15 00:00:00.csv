1195491305503285249 2019-11-15 18:58:33 -0400 <DavidGillmor> @realDonaldTrump NARCISSISTIC INJURY occurs when a narcissist feels that hidden, true-self has been revealed. It is the case when the narcissist experiences a fall from grace such as when their hidden behaviors or motivations are revealed.  Narcissistic injuries can lead to narcissistic rage.
