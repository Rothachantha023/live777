1113592003919376387 2019-04-03 19:59:57 -0400 <learnin97873684> @JuddLegum Is @realDonaldTrump the most powerful? I find a whingy cry-baby.  He can destroy the world, but is that power? or a tantrum.  As pres, he's never made a successful deal or solved a real problem. Destroying isn't power, it;s global failure.

1113592000153051136 2019-04-03 19:59:57 -0400 <Sportsworld716> @realDonaldTrump Breaking from NYT: Some of Mueller's investigators have told associates that A.G. Bill Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for Trump than Barr indicated.

If you look at the foot draggers though from the vote, they were all Republicans.  Watch those few, they are your enemies, not the Democratic party or the press.
