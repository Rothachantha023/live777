1122289313386061825 2019-04-27 19:59:58 -0400 <StHettie> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Nope. Too much going on. There's the Correspondents Dinner, and Samantha Bee's Not the White House Correspondents Dinner. You just can't compete with the entertaining things going on. You need new material. Alternately whining and bragging just doesn't sell seats. Bad ratings.

1122288737382170625 2019-04-27 19:57:40 -0400 <GNicholas66> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Hey fatso, are you going to tell us that you won the election? Really cool if you also told the big crowd your class ranking. They would be happy.
1122288736216154112 2019-04-27 19:57:40 -0400 <danrockss> @realDonaldTrump I could have ended my suffering by going to get Suboxone from a doctor but I chose not to! Because that's the new CDC rules and that must be what they're making money on now Suboxone and methadone! And its spending billions of dollars they should all go cold turkey like I did
1122288734878097408 2019-04-27 19:57:40 -0400 <SandiAnthony1> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Again,so disgusting. You should cancel the rally. We are going to vote you out and so is Wisconsin. All you do is preach hate and division and then try to pretend you had nothing to do with it when somebody acts on it. You are a disgusting excuse for a human being

Just listen to his lies at his rally. I would be ashamed to attend his rally. Anyone who goes to these thing don’t not live in reality. When someone lies every other word, how can he be believed.

Trump lowballs withholding tables to "get more $ into taxpayers hands" on front end, takes as little as possible so people think it's working, give biggest tax breaks to wealthy, then strap middle class w/ revenue shortfall. 👍🤦🏼‍♂️

Nope, the only way Trump will leave is in handcuffs. That day will be declared a National Day of Cleansing.
