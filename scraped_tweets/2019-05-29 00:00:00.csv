1133885452170252288 2019-05-29 19:58:53 -0400 <SpencerMorganIV> @realDonaldTrump Actually, no, to be innocent there should be no evidence of guilt, and maybe some proof of innocence. Lack of evidence merely proves there is no finding of guilt. "Not Guilty" is not the same as Innocence. Talk to Sekulow, he probably know this (Giuliani, not so much)

1133885336411619328 2019-05-29 19:58:25 -0400 <dennisfurlan> One of the considerations for any prosecution is whether a conviction is likely, right? Does anyone think a #Republican-controlled Senate will convict @realDonaldTrump after #impeachment? But the #Democrats and the #media still want to waste everyone's time, don't they. Next.

1133885333098172417 2019-05-29 19:58:24 -0400 <LLPreddy> @JeffLandry @realDonaldTrump 1.  No, the court declares a criminal defendant ‚Äúnot guilty.‚Äù 2.  Mueller explicitly stated that if they could have exonerated Trump, they would have. 3.  Mueller didn‚Äôt say there ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt enough evidence,‚Äù he said the OLC opinion would not allow him to indict Trump

1133885331252498432 2019-05-29 19:58:24 -0400 <coachpatp> @JeffLandry @realDonaldTrump Still wrong. A judge and/or jury convicts (guilty) or acquits (not guilty).  Where there is insufficient evidence to indict, the matter doesn‚Äôt proceed. A finding of guilt is for the court.

He chose the latter. Saying Trump was guilty was literally impossible from the start of the investigation.

In adherence to DOJ policy, Mueller has stated it is not his position to prosecute. It is UP TO CONGRESS. THEY WILL IMPEACH. Mueller DID NOT SAY you were innocent and/or exonerated from collusion/conspiracy and obstruction.  You‚Äôre a criminal.

1133885130827796480 2019-05-29 19:57:36 -0400 <donkeylawyer> @JeffLandry @realDonaldTrump The issue isn‚Äôt the quantum of evidence, it‚Äôs that DOJ policy forbids indicting a sitting president? Are you a Cooley grad or just naturally stupid? Did you read the report?

1133885125219897346 2019-05-29 19:57:35 -0400 <SexCounseling> I commented on @realDonaldTrump tweet and received close to 500 negative responses.  I blocked most of them.    This indicates that I hit a nerve regarding Biden, and how people really do see him, and stating the obvious made them angry, because a part of them knows its true!

1133885024317480961 2019-05-29 19:57:11 -0400 <MarianCantwellF> You LIE.  You and all leftists have NEVER "respected" that we voted @realDonaldTrump into office, and that he is our duly elected president!  Eric's LIES matter...

1133885013815189505 2019-05-29 19:57:08 -0400 <patrickahearn> @realDonaldTrump You can be found "not guilty" not "innocent" and that is after a trial.

1133885005116186626 2019-05-29 19:57:06 -0400 <trackallan> @realDonaldTrump Donald, I'd love the opportunity to "stick up for you" during your impeachment hearings. I'll say things like, "my client isn't a criminal, he just habitually breaks the law" and "my client shouldn't spend a day in prison, but a penitentiary would be fine."
1133885004788973569 2019-05-29 19:57:06 -0400 <thetruecq> And at the top of the list, impeaching @realDonaldTrump for #Obstruction  #DrainTheSwamp  #VoteBlue2020   üçé

1133885003673276425 2019-05-29 19:57:06 -0400 <squirrelinNH> @WSJ puzzled, WSJ, all your readers have gotten what they want from @realdonaldtrump -- ability to poison environment, huge tax cut, putting women back in their "proper place", etc., so why are you still defending him?
1133885003249704960 2019-05-29 19:57:05 -0400 <RuthNaomiEsther> @realDonaldTrump Mueller didn‚Äôt return charges against Trump because of a Department of Justice memo saying a sitting president can‚Äôt be indicted -- not because his investigation determined crimes were not committed.
