If you tell a foreign entity that they have to charge 20% more for their cars, the American citizens have to pay 20% more for that car so fewer people buy that car.

It in no way means they do not want immigration addressed.  Meanwhile, they need to write up a Code of Conduct for a President.

1080976651431936001 2019-01-03 18:58:11 -0400 <boricua4024> @realDonaldTrump The wall is a really bad idea. Why? Because $5 billion would only cover 80 miles of wall. That does not include all the litigation it would take to declare some of the private lands the are along the border ‚Äúeminent domain‚Äù. So it could take Trillions to complete the wall!

Nothing in his background leads me to believe that he would. Especially with a Republican Senate. Besides Trump has done nothing to be impeached. Being obnoxious is not a valid reason for it.

We are NOT the people we were when we fought World War 2. Now, most of our young are so weak they get upset when you say things they don't like. I can't imagine what they'd do if they had to live in Afrin, or any of Rojava. They'd hide in fear.
