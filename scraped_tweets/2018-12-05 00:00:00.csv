1070467664492064768 2018-12-05 18:59:14 -0400 <DwellerYsul> @realDonaldTrump Really, no one has yet explained to this football that America citizens paying tariffs is not increasing the nation’s wealth? Though, to be fair, they may slightly offset the exploding budget deficit.

1070467652001251328 2018-12-05 18:59:11 -0400 <DStewart541> Other Senators should take note of @SenKamalaHarris . This is what a senator does; works for her constituents and puts her represented state first, not kiss @realDonaldTrump 's ass!

If minimum was 14 here and tax rate was 20% to give you paid for healthcare, NO DEDUCTABLES think that's a pretty good trade. Same in Britain,  Norway etc.  America is a developing Shithole.

I’ve worn 18 pieces of PPE and had 20 minute lockout procedures in plants that have ahead Safety committees. And if you believe that a committee dedicated to a certain cause will contradict it, you’re the thick one.

All the money, expensive (but lumpy) clothes and the veneer of success can't hide it from anyone that is paying attention. That's why his base loves him so: He is one of them.

1070467092028125184 2018-12-05 18:56:57 -0400 <lotusg13> @PoliticalAnt @GOP @realDonaldTrump They want to have the excuse to cut Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and Welfare.  The collective tax cuts of the last 3 decades = exactly how much those programs cost.  Assholes, the lot.

Maybe to the polluters, but it should be. If there is no restrictions to their pollution, they'll do it. There's no reason we shouldn't be making it difficult to pollute our country.

Bernier says CPC can't win polling slightly below the Liberals. PPC is polling off the radar at 0.8% and Bernier is currently losing his own riding. The Twitter politician didn't tweet those poll results to you?
