1188968684896710657 2019-10-28 19:59:59 -0400 <Alwaystruthseek> @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump Aren't you supposed to state that Trump is a genius or that he is too smart for everyone? Aren't you supposed to call him "Sir" or show him respect in your posts? He's reading these. He's looking for your due diligence in showing him honor. You'd better shape up. His excellency?

Also, you are supposed to tell OUR gov. about this stuff BEFORE anyone else finds out. Those are the rules. Adam Schiff is doing his job, and doing it rather well. Buh-Bye

He clearly tried to mimick Barack's announcement that Osama Bin Laden, the mastermind behind 9-11, was killed. But if you ever see the beheading videos where the heads of human beings are sliced off while the victims gasp for air...
