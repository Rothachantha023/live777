I'd rather have conversations as individuals. I do not impugn anyone for their politics. Sadly, there seems to be a trend of doing so, of lumping all humans with differing ideologies together as "other."  We are all complete people, not ideology.

He tweets classified information.  He has called on foreign leaders to intervene in our elections, ON TELEVISION, multiple times.  These are not opinion.
