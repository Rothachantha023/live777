I personally have not been in any corrupt churches like that. I have grown up in churches teach that God sent His son because He loves John 3:16 with no financial giving required.

They're the Pharisees Christ warned his followers not to emulate 'cause they are hypocrites w/wicked, greedy hearts.  https://t.co/jiRbjxHblQ
