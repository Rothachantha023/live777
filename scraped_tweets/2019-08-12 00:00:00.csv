Even though I VOTE Democratic, I have never ONCE stated on here I AM one. Assumptions are dangerous son.  And what exactly is your basis for the statement you made?...Do you have facts to back it up?..I would LOVE to see them!
1161064293284007936 2019-08-12 19:57:53 -0400 <TheRealKyleOrd> @DrPaulGosar @realDonaldTrump @POTUS It must be so difficult living in a world full of conspiracy theories. The fear you must feel on a daily basis. I hope one day you get the help you need.

We know that in this case if were really being honest that he was out to hurt with that list. So if you want to keep campaigning and elections pure, then do so.
1161064290843017217 2019-08-12 19:57:53 -0400 <SeriouslyLuiz> @realDonaldTrump Way to go, obviously you can't be trusted with classified material, Donny dummy.

That doesn’t change the facts that the allegations are arguably arguable. Have a ball with your 2 friends

How many immigrants get services vs AMERICANS. It will be another LIE.  Like that voter fraud propaganda.  Turn out republicans were getting busted for voters fraud. You want them to pay taxes. But, reap no benefits.  https://t.co/F1xxLMgJGZ

1161064185125466112 2019-08-12 19:57:27 -0400 <manhattan_liz> @MarkSanford @realDonaldTrump .@MarkSanford @RepSanfordSC Just said he would vote for Trump over Biden. And he's not even running for office. What's wrong with these sick bastards?   So Repubs, who were the party of fiscal conservatism, vote for racism, the highest spending &amp; deficit ever, &amp; trade wars?
1161064184542650368 2019-08-12 19:57:27 -0400 <jtobia4> @realDonaldTrump Only a matter of time until your little boyfriend in NK fires off a nuke. Still going to exchange “beautiful” letters then, moron? I wish we had a real president. So do a lot of people.
1161064182663397376 2019-08-12 19:57:27 -0400 <MarciS73612682> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Ronna, you are a lousy GOP Chairwoman, your propaganda weak &amp; transparent.  Look to your leader, trump, for examples of socialism, eg; giving farmers our $$ to offset his tariffs.  The farmers don’t want handouts, they want productive farms.  We want our normality back.

1161064172303441920 2019-08-12 19:57:24 -0400 <Djohn333> @realDonaldTrump Trump sums up his assessment of a complicated situation with 2 words.....Not good! It applies to many complicated situations Trump is engaged in. North Korea? Not good! China? Not good! Middle East? Not good! President Trump? Not good!

You’re the only 1 on @billmaher or anywhere else that I’ve ever heard admit that wealth distribution %ages across a society affect the public peace. You’re right about a lot. Why don’t YOU run in 2020?

You never once said anything nasty about him. But if a black football player wants to exercise their right as Americans to freedom of speech, you want to fine them or worse
