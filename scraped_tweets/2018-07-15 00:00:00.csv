Whether it’s because the pee pee tapes are real or you’re a fool, or both, is irrelevant. The facts are you’re hurting your allies and giving succour to traditional enemies, which makes you a traitor. How’s that for truth?

1018645673967841280 2018-07-15 19:57:08 -0400 <AndrewCMcCarthy> @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, it’s not about how well *you* do. It’s about whether America does well by having a meeting you don’t have to have that inflates the prestige of an anti-American thug regime we should be squeezing rather than burnishing.

Wasn’t it Obama that gave billions to Iran. Then he gave 2500 un-vetted Iranians citizenship. Let our jobs and technology go overseas. Yet he is now a millionaire along with all of his cronies! I now see you are just ignorant.
1018645372418260993 2018-07-15 19:55:56 -0400 <amj_bewitched> @TrumpBabyUK Any chance y'all can put one in every town Trump visits with one in sight of the @WhiteHouse? You could make a mint selling these &amp; toy versions, with all proceeds going to the #RESISTANCE. It's the logical next step! Thanks for flying @realDonaldTrump's true colors!

1018645359919280128 2018-07-15 19:55:53 -0400 <GregWilliams12> @realDonaldTrump Why is it the republicans in Congress know without doubt Russian interfered with elections and yet they do nothing to protect America?
