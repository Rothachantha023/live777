1090761208767107072 2019-01-30 18:58:32 -0400 <jlblan2> @realDonaldTrump The fastest way to get the deep swamps attention is to push for a 50% income tax for Federal employees (especially politicians) with NO exemptions or deductions. They then will have a problem taxing the middle class and calling it taxing the rich.

The reason it's named "Global Warming" is that the Global Average Temperature is Rising. If it continues to do so, cataclysmic Climate Change is already happening and will CONTINUE to get WORSE.

From its nadir in March 2009 to when he handed the WH over to you, the Dow more than tripled.  To match his record, you'd have to wind up with a Dow over 60,000.  Good luck with that.
