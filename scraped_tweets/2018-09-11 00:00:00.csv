They had a very troubled electrical system before the hurricane but they still had electricity with rolling black outs &amp; frequent power failures. It was still better than what they were left with after the hurricane which was 0, for far too long.

He didn't even realize that Puerto Rico is a part of the U.S.; that they are citizens. As usual, he just goes all Michavellian and tells the biggest lie.

1039664147355656193 2018-09-11 19:57:03 -0400 <StephaneHus> @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump The "3000" figure come from the discrepancy between death rate from annual average. Nobody can tell to what extent the hurricane influenced the death rate (even though it's clear that the after effect of the hurricane had a trumendous impact, the "3000" is a rabbit out of a hat)

1039664128451723264 2018-09-11 19:56:58 -0400 <Stephenwc24> @realDonaldTrump Rush Limbaugh's radio broadcast today was fantastic.  He said that the Mueller investigation is unconstitutional and should have never started - because there is no crime.  And after 2 years of wasting tax payer's money, it needs to stop and now.  God bless you!

Terrorism killed those people and that is horrible. But. Your racism killed over 3000 Puerto Rico American citizens. American citizens! You! You are worse than bin Laden.

Since Congress has, heretofore, refused to do its job (i.e. strengthen immigration laws &amp;protect our borders) the Prez must do what he can, meanwhile, to protect our country.
