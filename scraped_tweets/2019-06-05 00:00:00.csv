The British hate you as much as good people in the U.S.  The only crowds were the protestors.  You are a loser and always will be.  The sooner you are gone the sooner we can get back to a stable America.

1136422148707368962 2019-06-05 19:58:48 -0400 <dismyaccount66> @realDonaldTrump Clearly the "tariff" is a thinly veiled stab at US Citizens because so many of us hate you &amp; want you thrown in jail. Anybody with 1/2 a brain (so, not you) is aware the prices will be jacked up to cover the "tariff" until we can't afford anything at all. Smart economic strategy!

1136421612570460161 2019-06-05 19:56:40 -0400 <voodoodad> @realDonaldTrump Y'know... you really should've attended at least a few of those economy classes when you went to Wharton fifty years ago.  Then again, all those crushed Adderall over the years have taken their toll.
1136421612033662981 2019-06-05 19:56:40 -0400 <DesdemoniaR> @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Just wow. Obviously you missed the part your boy Mitch played in this. Interesting how GOP only see a made up view of the world.

1136421605184327683 2019-06-05 19:56:39 -0400 <GrandeDean> @realDonaldTrump Congress will block this ludicrous idea...

1136421600562012161 2019-06-05 19:56:37 -0400 <MicahKolding> @EkibenKun @MiaFarrow @realDonaldTrump So it's the Democrats' fault he golfs every 4.4 days. Cool story, bro.  Look at any economic trend for the past ten years; your master inherited the tail of a thriving economy.

They both have experience but Warren is more progressive IMO, Biden is not ready for THIS GOP
1136421593406533632 2019-06-05 19:56:36 -0400 <jaxxwalton1> @realDonaldTrump @BetteMidler You are a truly horrible man!  You should be forced to apologize to several people but of course you never will.
