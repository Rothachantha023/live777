I've told you once, I've told you twice. This is my third and final objection to your travesty of the English Language. You have been warned. "Suffice to say"

Only 31 states were won by Trump....but again, that's over half of the states in which he won! Just bc some states are more populated than others, they shouldn't be able to call the shots for the more that voted otherwise. Thus, the electoral college!

Where's your mind at changing "pool" to "hot tub"? 😄
