969723252678561792 2018-03-02 18:56:54 -0400 <FidelisToJusti1> @IvankaTrump But @realDonaldTrump's only plan is to abuse infrastructure to reward his crooked developer friends w/no bid contracts. No infrastructure gets fixed. Govt is overbilled. Oligarchs get richer. Honey stick to what u know best: shopping w/profits from ur sweatshops. #SweatShopQueen

Your candidate was crazy about NAFTA which hubby Bill signed, &amp; also TPP, and then started flipping one by one. Trump said he'd renegotiate them, or cancel them. Now, what does it look like he's doing?
969723250535215104 2018-03-02 18:56:54 -0400 <elrubio1027> @realDonaldTrump So you've decided to go into a Trade War with the World. Nice. I love your AGENDA. Lower the Corporate Tax Rate in America for THE RICH. Raise taxes on everyone else. Raise Tariff charges, stick the bill to American workers. It's ok you still have your tax cut.

If Obama didn't get anything done to keep kids from being shot up in their schools then 45 shouldn't bother? What an asinine line of thinking. Oh and side note, one of the things Obama did do, @realDonaldTrump reversed.
