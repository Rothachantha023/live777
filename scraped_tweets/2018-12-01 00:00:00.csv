1069016607140261888 2018-12-01 18:53:15 -0400 <MartinHuizing1> @TheMama2G @realDonaldTrump You seemed to have spelled ‚Äúwe‚Äù wrong, please try again without feeling the need to try to speak for all of us.
1069016606125240320 2018-12-01 18:53:14 -0400 <twitleo2> @RonFalzone @realDonaldTrump Also did the Buches, does that mean the USA President should not pay he's dinal respect to a past President on his funeral? You are all disgusting with your outrageous constant hate for the POTUS.
1069016602912464897 2018-12-01 18:53:14 -0400 <MyFairLady007> @martinblank1969 @sporocarp @realDonaldTrump Everyone knows the Washington Post is anti-tromp, give me something better &amp; unbiased.
1069016597568921601 2018-12-01 18:53:12 -0400 <dundeetaxguy1> Hey Donald @realDonaldTrump

1069016594133762049 2018-12-01 18:53:12 -0400 <_DrMG_> Trump is a typical white supremacist coward. @realDonaldTrump
1069016593471062016 2018-12-01 18:53:11 -0400 <PassionFruit62> @MizRo2017 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse It‚Äôs already a gif on Twitter. Look closely and you can see Diddling Don swagger in the room.   Red tie hanging to his knees.  https://t.co/K3WipeB4kt
1069016586168819713 2018-12-01 18:53:10 -0400 <catluvr317> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews Hannity hasn't a clue about anything.
1069016584457347072 2018-12-01 18:53:09 -0400 <peteralanwaller> There‚Äôs vocabulary in this tweet that @realDonaldTrump has never used in his life and frankly wouldn‚Äôt understand if you asked to explain it.
1069016581819244545 2018-12-01 18:53:09 -0400 <NYCmommie71> @jgscouler1 @AntonioSabatoJr @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Yes free. He donates his full salary. He was wealthy beyond measure b/f becoming the president. Unlike the rest of the criminals who got rich in office.
1069016581420843011 2018-12-01 18:53:09 -0400 <lauraecatt> @TruthWrite @realDonaldTrump I love President Trump Twitter you put my response in the wrong place on purpose
1069016579218771968 2018-12-01 18:53:08 -0400 <RhinoBug> President @realDonaldTrump, I voted for you, but I'm stumped.  If there are only $3 Trillion physical Fed dollars in existence, how can we ever logically pay back the PRIVATE CORRUPT FEDERAL RESERVE BANK the $21 Trillion we owe them? #DebtSlavesUntilWeDestroyThem #EndTheFed #MAGA
1069016578614800384 2018-12-01 18:53:08 -0400 <dieb1948> @klyne_donald @irishrygirl @realDonaldTrump Christ we all would...let‚Äôs see he ran the cia...he was there when John f Kennedy was killed so since he did nothing he sucked at the job.  He started a war...
1069016577352261633 2018-12-01 18:53:08 -0400 <lizwool3> @ProudResister @realDonaldTrump Hard to imagine it being worse than it already is.
1069016577020850176 2018-12-01 18:53:07 -0400 <Deridiculus1> @realDonaldTrump @GOP I can honestly say that he is missed now more than ever.

1069016572176539648 2018-12-01 18:53:06 -0400 <onetermcongress> @Djohnson1978 @realDonaldTrump Lets see here....An American is one who supports someone that has lied to them over 6,000 times, lost two court cases for fraud in Dec 2016, sides with a former KGB agent and a Saudi prince over his own American Intelligence agency even though one attacked the U S elections..I C.
