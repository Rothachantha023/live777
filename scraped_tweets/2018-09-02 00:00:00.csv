Then we could have a special election to clear up the mess the Russians, Comey Ryan, McConnell (Ryan &amp; McConnell knew what was going on with Trump and Russia before the election) and others messed up.

That's how accurate it is now. By the way in the real world 63% want Mueller to continue his probe on Russia and 60% want Jeff Session to stay as Attorney General, so don't do anything stupid.

1036403326458490880 2018-09-02 19:59:43 -0400 <cabresch> Trump [@realdonaldtrump] doesn't like the military or military personnel.  It doesn't matter that he claims differently--he is a LIAR, and he has a proven record of lying.  What matters is what he does, and what he does to treat the military just like he does women: screws them.

1036402451958489088 2018-09-02 19:56:14 -0400 <UnmitigatdTruth> For one, the elected representative should spend her efforts in helping her constituents by working with the @POTUS @realDonaldTrump instead of just focusing on "resisting" our duly elected President.  But politics and ego come first to LIBs.

1036402440701128704 2018-09-02 19:56:11 -0400 <elliotcwilliams> Yep. Critical point lost in discussion of the "60-day rule" (which says DOJ should exercise caution in taking action around election season): @realDonaldTrump isn't even on the ballot (shocking as that may feel). DOJ can't disrupt the election of someone who's not a candidate.

He can be summed up in one word: #Narcissist (if you like complexity #NarcissisticPersonalityDisorder) Whatever name, it's #narcissism Treating #narcissists requires ego deflation. Being @POTUS inflated his to monstrous proportions.
