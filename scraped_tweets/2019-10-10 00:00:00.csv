1182445618603515904 2019-10-10 19:59:38 -0400 <DbTofuguy> @realDonaldTrump The #Kurds DID fight on the Allied side in WW2. They helped break the siege after the 1941 pro-Nazi Coup d'état in Iraq &amp; were part of the (pro-Allied) Iraq Levies. In 1942 Kurds made up 25% of the force. By 1943, 10 of the 44 companies of Iraq Levies were Kurdish. @Akil_N_Awan
