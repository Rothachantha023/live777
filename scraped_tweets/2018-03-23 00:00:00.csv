977333970856636416 2018-03-23 19:59:11 -0400 <FPB_YT> Trumps only defense for signing #OmnibusGOPbetrayal is because of the military budget. That‚Äôs like spending 20 grand on some hooptie 85 Buick Regal just because it has 20s under the fenders and 12s in the trunk. @realDonaldTrump just signed his own #impeachment. #MAGAfraud
977333966557491201 2018-03-23 19:59:10 -0400 <Brenleighd> @realDonaldTrump Bump stocks can‚Äôt be regulated.  It‚Äôs important this was not a statement of Obama‚Äôs preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law. Trump is a LIAR!!  &amp; allows mentally ill to buy guns.

None of the dishonest media or Dems will admit we have the House and Whitehouse, but 9 Dems control the Senate. We know that your priority is the military and the funding was historic! Keep fighting for us, Sir. We won't let you down!
