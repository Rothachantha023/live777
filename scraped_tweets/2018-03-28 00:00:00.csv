979145600414429184 2018-03-28 19:57:57 -0400 <Char74able> @realDonaldTrump I find it amazing that so many do not understand the simple concept of controlled immigration. Neither do they understand the difference between a legal immigrant &amp; an illegal 1. Controlled immigration keeps you safe. It does not stop immigration.
