YOU brought up politics. Why? ONLY conceivable politics would be USA vs Russia ie foreign politics and then you'd apparently take RUSSIA's side? Is that your politics?

Senate or the House, But after much reflection I would not wish that on you. With the exception of a select few, Honesty and Accountability checked out over 20+ years ago! I respect you too much to ask ! TY

Putin bought the NRA and GOP with laundered money and has been doing it for years. Russian Money - buying American politicians.

Showing his ignorance, he should know NATO Article 5 invoked only once - after 9/11 when Estonia helped us and sent its troops to Afghanistan. We should rightly reciprocate if needed!

It wasn't in his political interest so he ignored the issue until he couldn't ignore it any further.  At that point he put a band aid on the issue.
