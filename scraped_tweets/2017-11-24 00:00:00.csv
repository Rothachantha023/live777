I didn‚Äôt know they made the most criminally investigated, man of the year! But, then again it‚Äôs a year of new firsts. Maybe you could split the cover Roy Moore..

934209700224229383 2017-11-24 18:58:43 -0400 <cococrazy72> @realDonaldTrump You do realize that Adolph Hitler was Man if the Year. It is not necessarily given to one who is good and honorable.
934209699368419328 2017-11-24 18:58:43 -0400 <isaiahIWC1022> @realDonaldTrump Mr. President please help us Citizens of the United States veto the FCC's bill to destroy net neutrality, please as our rights to open businesses online, and To have the freedom of Speech.

934209698705952768 2017-11-24 18:58:43 -0400 <ProfSteveKeen> @realDonaldTrump This is beyond pathetic. Swap the Oval Office and the golf course for a therapist's couch

The sword means to separate Christians from non-believers (don't hang out together) It is NOT a directive to KILL ANYONE! Your reference to Luke is from a PARABLE - an illustrative STORY - Once again, it is NOT Jesus telling anyone to kill!

934209680313692160 2017-11-24 18:58:39 -0400 <Victorsings> @realDonaldTrump Good thinking, since Colin Kaerpernick is much more likely to win anyway. Did you know he was Man of the Year at GQ Magazine? :)

934209674311880704 2017-11-24 18:58:37 -0400 <JosephCerquite1> @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Maybe, just maybe ISIS had something to do with this alleged increase. Ya think? San Bernardino? NYC? Beheadings, drownings, car and truck attacks on civilians? I think this just might be a cause for angst.
934209673951154181 2017-11-24 18:58:37 -0400 <JRichard685> @realDonaldTrump You do realize the Person of the Year could be the one with the WORST influence on the world, right? In that case, you'd qualify.
