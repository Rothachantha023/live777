1004875498743189504 2018-06-07 19:59:23 -0400 <CellarDoor55> @realDonaldTrump You could just accuse him of some more historically inaccurate idiocy. Why not try out “didn’t you shoot Lincoln?” this time.
1004875497887666176 2018-06-07 19:59:23 -0400 <Oooooo_Donna> @realDonaldTrump Again: we have a trade SURPLUS with Canada. Your actions are going to hurt more farmers, livestock businesses, USA steel.  He should be indignant as you are accusing Canada of being a national security threat, you complete failure!

U are really reaching.  I know u hate Trudeau because he is basically everything u are not (young, handsom, intelligent, ect...).  U are just embarrassing yourself.

1004875252269232133 2018-06-07 19:58:24 -0400 <scottflinders> @realDonaldTrump American agricultural subsidies killed Mexican agriculture as a result of #NAFTA, should Canadian farmers face the same fate?

Tariffs are a 2 way street but u don’t  upset economic growth by imposing unnecessary tariffs / this man is just so out of touch ! Likes to be the strong man regardless of the consequences-simply idiotic - cant negotiate

Also, Senator Rand Paul should have @DonaldJTrumpJr testify under oath and press him on his bogus “client-privilege” argument. 😏  https://t.co/vDqYB4dQXS
