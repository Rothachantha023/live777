Why if drugs and terrorists and dangerous people are your goal why are we not building a wall on our Canadian border? Statistics prove that border to be more dangerous than the Mexican border.

1114678638564257792 2019-04-06 19:57:51 -0400 <PollyRestol> @GOPChairwoman @GOP @realDonaldTrump Trump said windmills cause cancer. Ha!
1114678638497226752 2019-04-06 19:57:51 -0400 <tammywoods40701> @realDonaldTrump So let's get this straight. Only your yes man Barr has claimed no collusion.
1114678637490593792 2019-04-06 19:57:51 -0400 <JIFTheChosenOne> @realDonaldTrump These "animals" are fleeing death threats and violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, three countries you are cutting off from U.S. aid.  If you are not going to help them be safe in their own country and try to help stabilize an area WE destabilized in the 70s and 80s,
1114678631282778112 2019-04-06 19:57:50 -0400 <eveh317> @realDonaldTrump Dear Donald--- I think you have missed the point and have yet to see the real report, not some watered-down version by one of your minions.   You are and will be in trouble for many years to come.  What a shame that you have behaved so badly.
1114678628363702272 2019-04-06 19:57:49 -0400 <Reese_Sharon2> @BenjaminZZR @realDonaldTrump Yes thank you Houston Texas

1114678625037635585 2019-04-06 19:57:48 -0400 <foofighter420> @realDonaldTrump Can we read the full report so we may make up our own minds what it says ? Or do we just watch Trump News on cable and believe every word?

1114678614585483265 2019-04-06 19:57:46 -0400 <bkohatl> @mike_pence @RJC @realDonaldTrump Trump said American Jews have a great Prime Minister in Netanyahu, does that mean American Jews are NOT AMERICANS? I know that Sheldon Adelson BRIBED TRUMP with $100 million for Republicans, to give his wife OUR NATION'S HIGHEST HONOR, OUR MEDAL OF FREEDOM. Corrupt TRUMP! @VP  https://t.co/iIIcpdZer9

Our Prime Minister celebrates the ethnic diversity of all our citizens. Only the bigots, xenaphobes and racists have an issue with that. Ethnocentrism is a waste.

Obama was blinded to the bottom line, his mission was to destroy the US.  Clinton, managed the bottom line but had no VISION; this gave him time to focus on the other side of his interests and focus -SEX.

And regardless of whether you would leak your driver's license, the Congress should have access to the report, especially since Barr's statement has already been called into severe question.
