1190779943069855744 2019-11-02 19:57:16 -0400 <MRams63276> @realDonaldTrump Thanks for proving your stupidity once again.  Do you understand the US is not made of Trump supporters? Do you understand many of them are now not supporters because they were let down?  For staunch Republicans they have you as a choice and can‚Äôt elect a decent Republican.
1190779942054879232 2019-11-02 19:57:16 -0400 <BillyRedacted> @realDonaldTrump Maybe you paid him/her 130k to "keep quite".  That's your bag.

They are accusing trump of doing what Biden has openly admitted to doing and trying to say Trump committed a crime. And even if Trump has done, End it appears he did not,it it was for the country not for personal gain. Trumps job is to enforce our laws.

Perhaps, if #3 plainoldDonny was to buy a small interest in the rally towns that he STILL owes money they would get paid.  Trump Ireland got paid, it looks like, in a matter of days!
