Stop the partisan hate. If YOU want to cut funding for Yucca Mtn, then do it. Pls do not cut funding for National Security. DHS needs to complete the barrier on the s. border, and enforce our laws.

A successful conviction would require 67 Senators to vote in favor of dumping Trump, but we only have 45 Democrats (plus 2 indies who caucus with them) there.  The 53 GOP Senators wouldn‚Äôt dare convict him.
