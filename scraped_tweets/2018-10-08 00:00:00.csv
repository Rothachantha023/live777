Too bad. You put up a horrible candidate and she got trounced.  Thanks for playing.  2020 is a wrap.  Enjoy MAGA.

1049448551560949760 2018-10-08 19:56:47 -0400 <whyte_sheri> @ABCPolitics @ABC Actually, the FBI was not allowed to do a thorough investigation &amp; interview ALL acusers &amp; witnesses so he was NOT proven innocent. Plus, he lied under oath.  But that‚Äôs ok with @realDonaldTrump &amp; @GOP   They no longer stand 4 honestly, integrity or decency! üò°

If you think Democratic Senators, legislators &amp; activists aren't getting death threats from the #Maga crowd daily, you've lost your mind.
1049448548427812869 2018-10-08 19:56:46 -0400 <PolyandS> @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Kavanaugh was not accused of sexual assault until less than 24hrs before the committee vote. Why?  Because Democrats purposely sat on the information for 45 days then used Ford as a pawn for their political agenda.  Backfired.  Dems are pathetic.  Vote Red. Get rid of corruption
