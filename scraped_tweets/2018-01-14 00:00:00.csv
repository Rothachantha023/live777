The majority of them know how awful their party and president is, but convince themselves, some how, that it is still better than the left.

952690849648922625 2018-01-14 18:56:13 -0400 <BlancaM860> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends President Obama came into office, inherited a country headed for recession and reversed it!  He saved the auto industry and restored our economy!  If he were white, the Republicans would not have obstructed him as they did, from day one of his Presidency! Talk about racism!

Trump has disregarded truth his entire life and in order to do so claims fake news. This is the logical progression of that arc. Republicans have now bought in to that mindset.

Every time he opens his mouth, it leads to embarrassment, anxiety and #Shame. @realDonaldTrump has become a #ReasonToSelfMedicate. Maybe if y'all medicated him, that would help.
