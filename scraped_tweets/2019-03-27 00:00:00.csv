More or bigger Gov is never the answer. Of course I'm a libertarian, so I don't like much of what the Gov does. The certainly screwed up the schools.
1111054676349382656 2019-03-27 19:57:31 -0400 <SocialWorkItOut> Reading about the @realDonaldTrump budget cuts, I'm reminded of the #GOPtaxScam. Most those profiting from it, don't need it. Now people in need (of things like #SNAP, #ACA subsidies, #PublicHousing, #ForeignAid, @SpecialOlympics) could be denied. Despicable.  https://t.co/tk4llUU0p4
