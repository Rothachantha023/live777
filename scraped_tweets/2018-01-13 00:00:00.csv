952328908690640898 2018-01-13 18:57:59 -0400 <cbarlew> Had this false alert in Hawaii happened 2 yrs ago we would have been asking if the system was hacked instead of panicking. I blame @realDonaldTrump  @POTUS . Are we great enough yet?!

952328893276573701 2018-01-13 18:57:56 -0400 <Monaheart1229> @winterschild11 @KBlasig @realDonaldTrump I'm trying to get better at that, too. I hate having my picture taken, but realized that if I don't let it happen, my kids will have no record... it's challenging, but important. I'm glad that you have those tapes. Maybe you could get them transferred to a disc?
952328892722941954 2018-01-13 18:57:56 -0400 <ACamille38> @kals55 @Franklin_Graham @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Sadly this seems appropriate. I am a Christian. It's something I don't talk about as much. Two things that Trump makes me so angry about: he has made me look at Patriotism &amp; Christianity differently. For all those that support him &amp; claim to be~ ugh. SMH. üòµüòî

952328891007455232 2018-01-13 18:57:55 -0400 <pfac51> I can confirm that @realDonaldTrump did not come thru for my family and I, &amp; did not let us borrow his DVD copy of the movie: ‚ÄúNational Security.‚Äù #FB
952328890411835392 2018-01-13 18:57:55 -0400 <StevePrimrose> @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump If you think the Holy Spirit is with this guy, you're insane. None of them would be anywhere near this buffune. Neither the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit. Pastor, you're embarrassing to actual Christians. Go away.
