They can still come to America the legal way.

1082063683994279936 2019-01-06 18:57:40 -0400 <usgloria> @realDonaldTrump The money spent for a wall can be used to get America back, house our Veterans, educate and feed our children. If the people we are paying in the government were not getting paid I am certain they would have already came up with a compromise.

The regional and local governments continued to function as normal. All state employees continued to be paid their wages. Rather different, don‚Äôt you think?

Are they wasting their money and time with a wall??? Wake the heck up, ignorance doesn't look good on anyone.
