Take land by eminent domain cutting off access to the river, which many value, then immigrants cross the river and are on US land outside the wall.  They are then eligible to request asylum.   This is poorly conceived!

1087137223852605441 2019-01-20 18:58:06 -0400 <SelkaDarla> @realDonaldTrump. Aren't you proud of the young men who mocked the Native American? That's what you are doing with your racist narcissistic rhetoric. You should be real proud of yourself. That's what you doing to the country. I don't think needing a wall is that important
