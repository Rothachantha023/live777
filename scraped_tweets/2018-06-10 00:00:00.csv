Basically a power move by him. Will it actually happen? Russia would have to make huge concessions.

1005962301529305089 2018-06-10 19:57:57 -0400 <laberge_vic> OBama tried to sabotage @realDonaldTrump during his last week in office by trying to start another unfounded Cold War with Russia.  @POTUS is above the petty games OBama and the Dems are playing.  Their treachery will bite them in the tush before it’s all over.

Obama was horrible for economy, focusing first 2 years instead on healthcare passed as an “Act”, not a Bill. Jobs were permanently lost, making Obama numbers better. Under Obama, Labor Force Utilization at lowest since 1950’s! Obama worst ever!

Stop the rich ppl who elected him(because he lost the popular vote) from getting richer. Once their pockets are hurt Trump will be out of office before 2020. Do it before he declares himself President for life. Which is what he wants to do

1005961646638952448 2018-06-10 19:55:21 -0400 <Gaminoeul> @realDonaldTrump  I wonder if a northern “border “wall” Is simmering  on trump’s mind now. OMG no need to guess who is going to be asked to pay for it.! #JustinTrudeau #ac360
1005961646441762818 2018-06-10 19:55:21 -0400 <WilliamMiOBrien> @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump I haven’t watched an NFL game since the Kaepernick thing started so now I’ve started to become a diehard baseball and hockey fan! #BoycottNFL
1005961645867270149 2018-06-10 19:55:20 -0400 <TheOnlyMrsTReed> @mattbrichardson @JohnBrennan @POTUS Speak for yourself. Of your 100% I guarantee you 65% do not support @realDonaldTrump @POTUS it's just a matter of time before that twit is dethroned and hopefully sooner than later jailed. #Resist #BlueWave2018 #ImpeachTrump #DotardDufus #VoteThemOut2018 #Resistance  https://t.co/OS1QIbP8ld

1005961636220407808 2018-06-10 19:55:18 -0400 <briscott112> @realDonaldTrump @g7 A man who is afraid of the truth is a coward.  Goebbles said “ ...the truth is the enemy of the lie...”. And so you battle the truth with your lies.

1005961631677837312 2018-06-10 19:55:17 -0400 <MySharona3> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump So Kayleigh...Trump will impose high tariffs on all cars made in Canada. You (and Donald) realize that CANADA DOES NOT HAVE AN AUTO INDUSTRY?  But there are U.S. car manufacturers in Canada, and they employ Americans. So tell me how Trump is advocating for the American worker?

1005961626456154112 2018-06-10 19:55:16 -0400 <JTDavis1997> I don't get why liberals still criticize @realDonaldTrump over his forcefully tight grip when shaking hands. You know what that hand shake says? It says don't screw with The United States of America or else that grip is going to get even tighter. #MAGA #POTUS #PresidentTrump
