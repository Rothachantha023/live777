965012693785698304 2018-02-17 18:58:49 -0400 <lindrich96> @realDonaldTrump Gun control IS NOT a Federal issue, but a state regulatory one.  Each state controls waiting periods. They can regulate munitions, and can ban the sale of specific weapons as well, sold or possessed within their state.  They don't want to either. And, it's NOT the NRA either.
