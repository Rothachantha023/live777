1062857392981823488 2018-11-14 18:58:44 -0400 <maddiehbabe> @realdonaldtrump  STOP ANY AID TO MEXICO!  They're aiding illegals to enter our country. How about if we did that to their border? Have you placed a call to Mexico's President yet? America is watching you and what you've said about immigration isn't ringing true in your actions!

1062857252414148609 2018-11-14 18:58:10 -0400 <The_Roni> @realDonaldTrump hides his misogyny. About as well as his racism.He called @gtconway3d Mr.Kellyanne. lWhich is more proof.He believes women aren't a equal. To a man.Yesterday he gets mad at @FLOTUS . Becuz her tweet to fire Ricardel. Made him look pussywhooped basically. Smdh

So it could pay for people to have Medicare/Medicaid that need it. Actually work on immigration reform. Probably visit our veterans and active military...

We'll see what the court says. Obama removed 3 reporters from AF1. He did not revoke their WH press passes  Trump is not an emperor. The WH is a public building with understandably restricted access, but not his private domain in its entirety

SB 1634 would have removed the threat of those trees impinging on the OPLs.   No tree limbs touching OPLs = No fires.  100% correct. There is no "proof", because Brown vetoed it. There's just common sense.
