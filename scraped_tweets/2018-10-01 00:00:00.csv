1046912100482846720 2018-10-01 19:57:50 -0400 <raortman> @GOP @realDonaldTrump If you favor 'strong law enforcement,' you're necessarily in favor of thorough investigations.  Can't have the latter without the former. Which means that you must be in favor of Robert Mueller finishing up his investigation into @realDonaldTrump 's ties to the Russian Mob. Yes?

I'm coming at co2 from: how it falls to ground, we can't breathe it &amp; it will accelerate the outgassing rate/process with every fraction of warmth we heat oceans by the layer of trash on top. Agree w/u global.warming is b.s. Breathing is the problem.
1046911320384315395 2018-10-01 19:54:44 -0400 <michaelcdeibert> @Acosta Someone should tell @realDonaldTrump that my hometown - solidly working class #Lancaster, #Pennsylvania - is about 35% Latino &amp; takes in up to 20 times more refugees per capita than the rest of the US &amp; they have contributed magnificently to the revival of the city.
1046911316403900416 2018-10-01 19:54:43 -0400 <Christi67835290> @BabaJiwewe @StutzThe @balcony_view @trueamerica1st @realDonaldTrump Have you ever considered the reason the unemployment rate is down is due to they have maxed out the benefits and can no longer receive therefore it appears they are employed when they actually are not or had to settle for a part-time job?
1046911316231827456 2018-10-01 19:54:43 -0400 <BambiBrownell> @realDonaldTrump I resent my tax dollars being spent on security for you to rant at your political Rally's where you just stir up hate, disgusting waste.
