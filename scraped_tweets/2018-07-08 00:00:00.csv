Dems: you're stupid because x Rs: I'm so offended that you would dare say I'm x, that I'm going to vote pro x Dems: sooo... Thanks for proving us right?
1016108887622250496 2018-07-08 19:56:51 -0400 <MaskFreeUSA> @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Haha. Lib troll.

1016108886451945477 2018-07-08 19:56:51 -0400 <dtnorth> @pink_lady56 @realDonaldTrump The US is not involved.
1016108882375204864 2018-07-08 19:56:50 -0400 <SpenceMar> @realDonaldTrump @USNavy Right on Mr President!! We love u and your unquinch able COURAGE!!
1016108881905270785 2018-07-08 19:56:50 -0400 <brianzilm> @luvtheblessing @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse No. I don‚Äôt know that. I‚Äôve researched it and it‚Äôs laughable at best.  We should end this back and forth. You look me up when Mueller presents his findings. Something tells me you won‚Äôt have a lot to say. I won‚Äôt gloat though. It‚Äôll be a sad day for the country.
1016108879338500099 2018-07-08 19:56:49 -0400 <CubsfanCo> @realDonaldTrump Trump I hope your pick gets blocked just like your cronies did Obama's chance to pick
1016108876683505665 2018-07-08 19:56:49 -0400 <LingQue88> @realDonaldTrump @USNavy Hi, Donald, when you have time, check out Dimash - the world best voice of all time! You will find perfect world in his performance...
1016108875173408769 2018-07-08 19:56:48 -0400 <Zochlette> @Heritage @realDonaldTrump This tweet ... it looks ... good!   But.  The Heritage Foundation?!?!  No. Not good enough.   You still suck.
1016108874481336320 2018-07-08 19:56:48 -0400 <MasterMixwell> @dylanmills24 @realDonaldTrump smart bet! sadly, the odds will be the opposite in 2020 bc Trump is winning too damn much. PS--followed you--victory loves company.
1016108872174428160 2018-07-08 19:56:48 -0400 <Riogallica> @SkyNewsAust @AdamBandt @realDonaldTrump Bandt has #greenmush for brains &amp; spews #greenslime everytime he opens his mouth ü§Æü§¢ The Government needs to put Australians 1st. The world's major polluters are not part of the Paris agreement.  üá¶üá∫are sick of being the patsies 4 other countries who still buy our coal 2 burn.
1016108870593404928 2018-07-08 19:56:47 -0400 <dhunger68> @realDonaldTrump @USNavy How about your buddies from Russia?
1016108870119411712 2018-07-08 19:56:47 -0400 <GawlinskiLaura> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Where are all the children you stole?
1016108869645406209 2018-07-08 19:56:47 -0400 <Bencc1960> @ecerv2004 @Bonita8a @danny_egbert @artgeo69 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump It never made it out of the house. You want him to rule as king and just make the laws or do you want the people we elected to do their jobs. If a bipartisan bill is brought to him to sign and he vetos it, that‚Äôs on him. But until that happens, it‚Äôs on congress.
1016108869326548992 2018-07-08 19:56:47 -0400 <Secret00owl> @realDonaldTrump Anyone that believes Russia or Putin was involved in the poisoning is an idiot, so obviously done by those who want to destabilize the US - Russia meeting.
1016108869192421380 2018-07-08 19:56:47 -0400 <kuroi_shizen> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You do know you can't nominate yourself right? I mean, I'm sure you would if you could.
1016108868802367488 2018-07-08 19:56:47 -0400 <zachtucker2007> @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Yet he still lost the popular vote.....
1016108867497943040 2018-07-08 19:56:47 -0400 <Jerseyobserver> @MZHemingway Please @DickDurbin have your Senators block @realDonaldTrump SCOTUS pick &amp; then we can wipe out those Democrats &amp; have a Republican majority.
1016108866340311040 2018-07-08 19:56:46 -0400 <chefjoe22> @amjoyshow the fact you even think this is a serious Candidate for the Dem party just shows you this party is in Ruins. @realDonaldTrump would make a mockery of that fool. But he of course would be great for your Joke of a show. Please promote him we beg u.  https://t.co/7XE53byTyN
1016108865182547968 2018-07-08 19:56:46 -0400 <AdamsDarrellj> @realDonaldTrump @KyleKashuv Still not happy about the options in that election...
1016108864574541824 2018-07-08 19:56:46 -0400 <maryrcook> @realDonaldTrump I'm a US citizen and I believe Mueller and his team are American Patriots and Heros unlike you.

1016108858589306880 2018-07-08 19:56:44 -0400 <Letterlout> @realDonaldTrump - how you gonna tackle Putin about an actual nobichok  murder in the UK ?

1016108858329071617 2018-07-08 19:56:44 -0400 <Daciegirl> @realDonaldTrump They didn‚Äôt believe it because you‚Äôre a joke. Just because you ‚Äúwon‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre a good president

If you think you‚Äôve matched a pseudonym to an actual person that is likely to be an unfortunate, distracting and potentially damaging coincidence.  https://t.co/HHSexKyLbl
1016108847235100672 2018-07-08 19:56:42 -0400 <ChazFarnham> @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You get no say at all!! You only have total resistance at all times which adds up to absolutely nothing! It‚Äôs time to become part of our country or shut the f up! Resistance means you have not worked in. A 1 and 1/2 years and now you want something?
1016108845230448640 2018-07-08 19:56:41 -0400 <gumbafive> @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump There were not illegal voters in any number that would have mattered. He won the electoral college. That is our system, so he‚Äôs President. Let‚Äôs not pretend he won any other way.
