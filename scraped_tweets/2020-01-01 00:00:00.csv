When history shows an increase in debt with republicans since the 80s! And an elimination of debt by Dems over 40 years...  That is solid history of what Dems will do in the future...

He failed that probationary period by not delivering on what he said he'd do (wall, Obamacare repeal, etc). So, he needs to be fired. That's not partisan.
