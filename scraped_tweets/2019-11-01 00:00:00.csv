The American people want to know how you and the rest of the Republicans are letting this farce go forward without any proof of any wrong doing, this is just Bullshit
1190418238884192256 2019-11-01 19:59:59 -0400 <ttthomas20> @realDonaldTrump Let me get this straight? The Biden's are connected to billions of dollars in Ukraine and you want to be sure there is nothing bad. Neither Biden has any experience in Ukraine oil. Why  are you investigated for trying to recognize if there is  fraud by the Bidens dealings in oil?
1190418238351593473 2019-11-01 19:59:59 -0400 <hoffman1971> @realDonaldTrump So are you saying the GOP is united that it is to ask other countries to investigate US citizens? And United on policies that help Putin against US interests? #SovietTrump

1190418061582487552 2019-11-01 19:59:17 -0400 <TonyPelch> @realDonaldTrump The beauty of it is that you released a transcript that perfectly gives Congress the responsibility to impeach and remove you from office.
1190418061398069248 2019-11-01 19:59:17 -0400 <thedoggeneral1> Democrats are not trying to change 2016 election.  We cannot get the past 3 years back.  This is about removing a corrupt, lying president from office.  This is about the future, repairing the damage &amp; insure US from 2020 election meddling. @realDonaldTrump

1190417942229315584 2019-11-01 19:58:48 -0400 <kelrobi11> @keny_berd The bottom line is that @realDonaldTrump was saying there were a lot of really bad people involved in corruption and he wanted to know what Zelensky could do to inform him as to what had happened. Who was @POTUS going to ask? Brennan? Clapper? So many things need to be remedied.

Then we can compare you to historical leaders. Bring it on!

You have yet to take ownership for any flaw u possess. Do you honesty think that your this perfect!

If he/she is a ‚ÄúTrump-hater‚Äù or not is irrelevant.  His duty was only to get attention to the corruption. The evidence will be found in the following investigation and revealed in the impeachment hearings.
1190417928308416512 2019-11-01 19:58:45 -0400 <JLG1017> @realDonaldTrump But someone who HAS done something wrong can be impeached--so while you may believe you've done nothing wrong, a good portion of America believes you have... it will be more after the evidence against you is made public.
