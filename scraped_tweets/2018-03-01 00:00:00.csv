969361126311038976 2018-03-01 18:57:57 -0400 <BennettRben> @realDonaldTrump No one has mentioned this.  Enroll teachers who volunteer through a certified police reserve program funded by a grant.  Then they could be in schools as teacher/reserve police officers.  That is a much more intense training program than a simple hand gun course.
