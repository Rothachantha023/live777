You don’t care about lives you damage in US. You call US homelessness a problem for ‘Democrat cities’, kidnap kids at border, deny climate crisis &amp; attack democracy. You could care less about humans

So, you’re right, I don’t like Trump.

Yet we know not all cops and lawyers are crooked or dirty.  So be careful how you toss those tasteless adjectives around.  Someone in the Oval Office needs to be reacquainted with the truth. Americans crave truth now &amp; always

And I will have Mexico pay for that wall," President Donald Trump said on June 16, 2015, when he announced his White House run.  "Mark my words," he said.

1216509802009985024 2020-01-12 18:58:33 -0400 <kehallor> @realDonaldTrump Because you betrayed the constitution with your actions. There is no way to remove the first line of every sentence written about you in the history books: “IMPEACHED”.
