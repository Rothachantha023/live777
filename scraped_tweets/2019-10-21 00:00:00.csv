He is conflicted because he still sees nothing wrong with it. And as his WH Chief of Staff says, "Get over It." Impeach this sleaze

1186431344152371200 2019-10-21 19:57:29 -0400 <IncognitoAngler> @realDonaldTrump  I do believe there are a few good people in the Dem party that do not like GOP and they are also well aware that their Dem party is totally CORRUPT. They have their reasons I guess. Those people should just leave the Dem party once again!  https://t.co/67m9nNZCoh
