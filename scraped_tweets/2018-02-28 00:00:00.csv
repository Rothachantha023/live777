968998409368633346 2018-02-28 18:56:38 -0400 <JSCookJr> @BretBaier @NRA @realDonaldTrump must think he’s President of New Jersey or some damn place.

968998399549853696 2018-02-28 18:56:36 -0400 <rodz_1959> @realDonaldTrump administration is placing our country in peril! The @GOP does nothing; they just watch the WH go up in flames!  https://t.co/ycRq4W3ry2
