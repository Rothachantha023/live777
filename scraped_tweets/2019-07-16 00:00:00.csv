1151280279882874881 2019-07-16 19:59:43 -0400 <TheFist18> @realDonaldTrump The liberal media really spun the crap out of those tweets mr president.  They turned "go back where you came from" into go back to some other countries.  Instead of go back to Brooklyn and fix the problems in the cities which you came from then come back to DC.   Spinning spice

YOU are the one cherry picking - pro-life - to fit YOUR ideology.

The Constitution of my country guarantees me that right no matter what trump says. And if criticizing the country is the criteria then he needs to leave. All he does is criticize the courts, the congress, the people, and the free press.

Of course you don't understand this because you have the attention span of a housefly and a disturbing belief that you are the center of the universe but you aren't.

We have been quite for too long letting these radical liberals spew their hatred. Then we get called “racists” when we disagree with anything they say. I’m sick of it. They are radical socialists and that is all they are.
