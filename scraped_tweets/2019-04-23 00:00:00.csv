Your extremely low approval rating, despite the economy, shows how truly awful you are as a leader. Americans also know that the economy has been growing for 10 years!

Did he forget Paul Manafort giving data to Russians or jared's attempt 2 set up a back channel or he, don jr. &amp; Paul's meeting with Russian lawyer?

1120839396436131840 2019-04-23 19:58:30 -0400 <jimmyotx> It’s humorous that on the day fail-son-in-law Jared tried to downplay foreign interference in 2016, the President whined to Jack about the fact that he lost many followers.   Many of those followers were bots &amp; spam accounts.   So which is it @realDonaldTrump?
