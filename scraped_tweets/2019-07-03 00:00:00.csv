The world is watching as you try to scare people away from participating in a constitutionally-mandated census so your GOP cronies can grab more seats in Congress. We see you.

1146569037981392902 2019-07-03 19:58:55 -0400 <aanalyst50> @realDonaldTrump A display of military might flies in the face of what US is all about. Founding Fathers were always suspect of a standing military force &amp; y they had a 2nd amend-in times of threat, avg Americans would be called to arms. This changed but military has remained in the background

1146568883760795648 2019-07-03 19:58:18 -0400 <Divinity11> @realDonaldTrump Thank you President Obama for the improved economy! Thank you every other president BUT THE ORANGE, FAT, GRIFTER for the military! Standing next to strong, powerful men will make you look less powerful, not more!

The Dems thought pretty highly of him then. Not now, of course, because anyone nominated by Trump is evil. Democrats are complete &amp; utter hypocrites. #VoteRed2020 #DemocratsHateAmerica

How can they be better off living in cages and sleeping on cold floors. Why don't you try it for a week see how long you last. Hopefully in 2020 we will get someone with morals and human dignity. Impeach immediately.

It is for America and I for one am damn glad and proud of the event. As are millions of others. The cost is nothing. Well worth it. Less than the waste of Mueller. Less than Moochelle spent.
