1156353580934336512 2019-07-30 19:59:12 -0400 <LouisGolia> @JoeNBC Joe, Trump has you rattled as he exposes you &amp; the left (Democrats) as the real enemies of America. Your lies and cooperation with the Democrats to overthrow the constitution. Mueller was proven to be corrupt. @realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo @jaketapper @nytimes @HeyTammyBruce @
1156353580753981440 2019-07-30 19:59:12 -0400 <GStein269> @realDonaldTrump The fact remains- you have not been exonerated. All the decision says is that the right to publish the emails were protected by the First Amendment. That's it in a nutshell.

You always accuse your opponent of whatever you are guilty of? It's DT who wants to turn the clock back to the 1970/80s, when he was a young, vital man. Now, not so much AND all those ideas are old and have been disproven and discarded

1156353491616567298 2019-07-30 19:58:51 -0400 <NoGoinBack> @nytimes So @realDonaldTrump felt the need 2 come 2 #MoscowMich's defence by saying "@senatemajldr knows less than me about #RussianInterference in our elections, &amp; I know nothing". That's like shooting holes in the bottom of a sinking boat in hopes of draining the water.
1156353491327172608 2019-07-30 19:58:50 -0400 <Grancoleconnor> @TimMurtaugh @realDonaldTrump Yes the Democrats are all the same. Why in the devil would any sane person want to pay for illegal immigrants health insurance? Take away Americans private health plans? Nothing but idiotic thoughtless ideas.

Problem is that the vast majority of your supporters don’t care how far you drag our country down so long as you keep promising to Make America White Again.
