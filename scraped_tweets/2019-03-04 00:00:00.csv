1102719531523420160 2019-03-04 18:56:38 -0400 <TtTWSTR> @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump More than fifty times as many deaths of US Citizens have resulted from our porous Southern Border than as a result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, yet you and your Congressional colleagues still fail to see the importance of this situation. Your priorities need to be reexamined!!!

1102719530302881792 2019-03-04 18:56:38 -0400 <Strat57L> @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump CC, you are a idiot! Now we have a third world nuclear power, and no military exercises with our allies in the immediate region to act as a deterrence to aggression towards those allies! Plus South Korea and Japan only have small American military bases! Not effective deterrent!
1102719529132666880 2019-03-04 18:56:37 -0400 <agirrrl> @funder @realDonaldTrump Repetition, repetition, repetition. He‚Äôll get it, eventually. üë®‚Äçüéì #TrumpCrimeFamily
1102719528759410689 2019-03-04 18:56:37 -0400 <IngridWeber67> What say you @realDonaldTrump?  Guess your threats as POTUS didn't work.   Scottish government wins Donald Trump wind power legal costs  https://t.co/BfNgRN0ehk
1102719527467520000 2019-03-04 18:56:37 -0400 <llitig8orDWJ> @kylemaxwell01 @GrahamAllen_1 @realDonaldTrump My buddy was an ICE agent in VT. You have NO IDEA what you‚Äôre talking about. You can walk in the back door of a church in Canada and right out the front door in the US. When my buddy was at said church DETAINING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS; Al Jazira was filming from the Canadian side.
1102719521171726336 2019-03-04 18:56:36 -0400 <Fact_Check_It> @janbyut @realDonaldTrump These people are not children - 2 of them ‚Äúwork‚Äù in the White House &amp; the others head businesses. They have their own crimes, AND came from criminal fathers. The unethical &amp; immoral family culture influenced them. @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @POTUS @FoxNews

1102719517162172416 2019-03-04 18:56:35 -0400 <fulltankss> @realDonaldTrump @AriFleischer I use to vote for the candidate I felt was best regardless of party. I will never vote Democratic ever again.

1102719504948387841 2019-03-04 18:56:32 -0400 <kkjohnson0318> I see the Globalists are on @BretBaier  On @FoxNews  Talking about @RandPaul and how he sided with @DNC concerning the attempt to block the executive action done by @realDonaldTrump . Bret's guest said: it's not the policy it's the separation of powers. No it's not....
1102719504226885632 2019-03-04 18:56:32 -0400 <ReadingJudith> Even more repugnant than .@realDonaldTrump , because you should know better. I thought you were better than that.
