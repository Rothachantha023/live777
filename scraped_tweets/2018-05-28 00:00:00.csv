He averages 6 lies or mistruths per day. Blames Dems for his direct actions yet props up putin. So yes only traitors support trump.

You choose to wish people a "Happy Memorial Day" and talk about yourself. Learn a lesson from @BarackObama. He simply thanked our heroes for their sacrifice and dedication.
