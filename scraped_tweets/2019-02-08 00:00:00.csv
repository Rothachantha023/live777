1094022103299473408 2019-02-08 18:56:10 -0400 <rrohwer> @realDonaldTrump Would an impeached president be considered not smart? Just curious....just in case.
1094022099583320064 2019-02-08 18:56:09 -0400 <Mike121948> @realDonaldTrump @GOP @tedcruz @RandPaul @MarkMeadows @LindseyGrahamSC   Without the House you can not legislate against this. I think Twitter, FB &amp; Google have made themselves the public square &amp; public utilities. Maybe you can regulate them. But for 2020 we need other platform
1094022098069024768 2019-02-08 18:56:08 -0400 <rodbmalone> @realDonaldTrump You can say it all you want but the investigation is neither a hoax or illegal.  The truth of it is that anyone who gets in your orbit gets sprayed with your shit.  BTW did Whittaker play on the line?   He Just had to remember to follow instructions.

This isn’t about any other presidency, it’s Teumps.  If there was any illegalities with earlier presidents, congress has an oversight committee and would have done something.
1094022095095373824 2019-02-08 18:56:08 -0400 <StHettie> @realDonaldTrump Oh, you're talking about Rasmussen. That's hilarious! They had you down by eleven a couple of days ago. Then they bumped it up for the SOTU. Then it went underwater again. Now this. They are an obvious outlier. Look at all the polls, bubba. It's hard to even see 50% from your 39%

1094022070889934849 2019-02-08 18:56:02 -0400 <christine_57> @realDonaldTrump Your tenure in public "service" is going to be very short, so I guess that means you're very stupid.... but we already know that.
