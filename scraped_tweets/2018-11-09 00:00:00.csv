The law specifically states you don't have to use an 'official' entry point to ask for asylum 2. @realDonaldTrump is ordering US forces to break that law actively and with malice  How is this not launching lawsuits?

1061045654753951744 2018-11-09 18:59:32 -0400 <SharedFreedom> @realDonaldTrump You should stop talking about things being an embarrassment.  The response out here in the real world is "Youre the embarrassment"  It's like you calling someone an Orangutan, it just hits a little too close to home.

Watching him deal with anyone who challenges him in the slightest, shows what a spoiled a-hole he is/was. Because of his money, nobody has ever told him no. He can’t handle pressure. He’s used to walking in a room and everybody kissing his butt.

You are...in your own words to @Acosta "A TEIBLE PERSON". The day you leave the White House is a party day for the majority of Americans who did not vote for you.

I never once said men shouldn't be able to talk to each other.  I know that, because I believe they should.  That doesn't erase the fact that Trump confessed to grabbing women by the genitals.
