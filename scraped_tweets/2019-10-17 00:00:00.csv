1184982035766472704 2019-10-17 19:58:27 -0400 <RogueBlueWave> @VP @realDonaldTrump Turkey said fuck off. Hillary saw that coming too.  The Impotus is an idiot. Trumptanic is sinking and your names will be remembered as those who raped a country and betrayed her people. #ImpeachAndRemove #Impotus #TrumpForPrison2020

All the PKK/YPG fanboys and sympathizers who were weeping about what they misleadingly called “ongoing genocide” are obviously NOT happy with this “ceasefire” deal.  Now ask yourself why and what their agenda might be..
1184982034596253697 2019-10-17 19:58:27 -0400 <Evaztlb> @realDonaldTrump I hope someone from El Paso shows up with an itemized bill and a summons to appear and pay the amount you skipped out on from your last rally in that state. Here's our Crooked President,  trying to Bankrupt the great state of Texas.

1184982025993883648 2019-10-17 19:58:25 -0400 <nmbirmingham> @realDonaldTrump Forced the Kurds out of their homes for Turkey; Mulvaney admitted you withheld funds from Ukraine to get them to investigate Democrats; Violated emoluments clause by booking G7 at a Trump property...Time to fly to Dallas, give an incoherent speech, and bask in the adulation!
