Over and over witnesses say there was a #QuidProQuo   You CAN‚ÄôT ignore @realDonaldTrump corruption!!  #ImpeachmentHearings  #standupforourconstitution #SC
1198389918080421888 2019-11-23 18:56:36 -0400 <ZBUniversity> @yayee36 @RepMarkMeadows Great idea. Once the @GOP is ousted and buried for good, including fancy jester @RepMarkMeadows, we should fight to implement the strongest protections against carnival grifters like @realDonaldTrump

In summary: "Fire the prosecutor [who is investigating my son Hunter's company] or you don't get the money. Just ask Obama. You have 6 hours." Is he on video? Yes he is.

President Trump dropped his guard and believed that career diplomats were fair minded. You can‚Äôt trust this to be true especially with the dynamic change POTUS sought to bring. He needed his own people to be in place.

If you want vaping to turn into a black market and for Trump to lose in 2020, go ahead with the idiotic #VapeBan. This is a life-saving remedy for ex-smokers. Parents, control your brats. #MsaBloodMoney
