1089311885953036288 2019-01-26 18:59:26 -0400 <DanielKepford1> @realDonaldTrump Offer amnesty to current illegals. Amnesty for only illegally entering into the country. Any crimes aside from traffic enforcement will not be eligible. These are people we actually do want in the country. People who work and raise families. Do this and you can have your wall.
