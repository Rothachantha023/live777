But I am more concerned about actions taken, which affect the constructionial freedom and rights of citizens, then the opinion of talk show pundents. So what do you think banning them from the military was cool?

Afghanistan is a complex place with various tribes &amp; ethnic groups.   The idea that we'd just "wipe them off the face of the earth" is crude, bloodthirsty, jingoistic crap. Try again.

Whatever it is they put on play phones for the kiddies these days. Teletubbies? Is that still a thing?
