Ryan wanted to do it before he left. Now Trump wants to give another cut to the wealthy by reducing Cap Gains tax.

1024081351132233728 2018-07-30 19:56:35 -0400 <Borgrum> @realDonaldTrump Isn't it very strange?! The President is asking questions and tbe official media does not answer those questions?!  CNN broadcasted an interview with Giuliani to express only their  big surprise (?!)  It is not strange - it is very weird  reaction by the mainstream media.

1024081337152675847 2018-07-30 19:56:31 -0400 <mum2anj> @realDonaldTrump Since when do you care about the whole world laughing at us??  You've made a mockery of our democracy by maligning the free press, openly flaunting your nepotism, celebrating your ignorance of the Constitution, and cozying up to Putin.  You don't think they're all laughing at us?
