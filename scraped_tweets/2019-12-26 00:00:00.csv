In Orange County the Goppers on the Board of Supervisors forced the corporations to pay for a homeless shelter. To do so is in their interest as the site of homeless encampment near their corporate offices is dismal

It seams that Mrs. Pelosi has forgotten some parts of 1)the separation of powers, 2)check and balances, and  3) the true structure of the U.S. Congress. Just because that she has forgotten them doesn‚Äôt mean they had gone away. They are still here.
