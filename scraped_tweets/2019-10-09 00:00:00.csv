Second, Pelosi does not have enough votes to impeach.  Too many dem reps live in realville, USA and like their cushy jobs.
1182083179382890496 2019-10-09 19:59:26 -0400 <levanssm1> @realDonaldTrump Shame on you and the Republican Party.  You sold out to Russia and probably at the price of them interfering with the 2020 election.  How can any of you sleep at night knowing what this Adminstration is doing.  Blood on your hands and it was easy for you to do this

The House has the right and in certain instances, like impeachment, the Constitutional duty to perform oversight of the Executive Branch. Trump must comply. Obstruction of Congress is also an impeachable offense. see, Nixon's Article 3.

I support POTUS Trump against the Dems and Deep State, but I can't support the decision to abandon the Kurds. They stood by us and fought with us when Turkey would not.
