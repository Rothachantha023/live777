It's working great for the rich, modestly well for the middle-class, horrible for the working poor and the poor in general. It will crash. Dems will be blamed. Dems will fix it.

Trump's economist said it would be $9,000  That didn't happen. But the superwealthy did great, and the budget deficit is now $1 trillion

1209986307121803264 2019-12-25 18:56:30 -0400 <Lord_Ballsley> @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, Newsom is using your concern for the people to bait you into making the other 49 states pay for the correction. California spent billions of their infrastructure funds on illegals and when a dam failed federal dollars were necessary.  Newsom is pulling a scam.
