1080252056303218689 2019-01-01 18:58:54 -0400 <NikitaKitty> @realDonaldTrump Kelly suggests that the declines are largely tied to the market's volatility in the last several months.  "Energy is so tied right now to the overall health of the economy. Fear is crude oil is going to fall off a cliff. "

Also domestic producers using fracking have higher costs than conventional drilling. They may shut down refineries until prices go back up. A stable genius would understand this.
