1058146036261314561 2018-11-01 19:57:29 -0400 <5_2blue> Is @realDonaldTrump now holding rallies in airplane hangers so  empty seats won't be shown? Like a garage band that can claim a monstrous crowd if they get a few people standing in the driveway.

1058146019064668162 2018-11-01 19:57:25 -0400 <bratacat> @DancerInTheMist @realDonaldTrump Looking at the 9/11 hijackers, I find it so telling that Trump never included Saudi in the travel bans (first one failed), yet they made up 15 of the 19 hijackers. The only reason is that Trump has businesses in Saudi, despite his lies. He is just a self serving, greedy, traitor.

I think you meant he didn’t expect it to be a middle-aged, semi-crazy white radical extremist.  P.S.  I’m not sure which terror event you were referring to from last week.  Not that it matters since my statement holds true for all 3 of them.

Ok, well, the folks in Parkland and Pittsburgh don't seem to be impressed by what Trump said. Or what Ivanka and Jared made him say, since it all didn't really come to him right away.
1058146016531304448 2018-11-01 19:57:24 -0400 <DaleMadHaz> @realDonaldTrump ...unless he loses, and then it’s his own fault. Hmmm... "Well, I try. I do try... and I always want to tell the truth.

That is not how a true leader succeeds. That is why you are flailing/failing.
