1058146177344925696 2018-11-01 19:58:02 -0400 <Shaeslife> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump is attempting to divide our country with hate, racism &amp; fake international terrorism. Trump is responsible for the shooter at the synagogue, the bomber, Kentucky shooter &amp; rise in hate crimes. This along with murderous despots he aligns with should disturb all.  https://t.co/Kr1M6jgzdb

The only reason is that Trump has businesses in Saudi, despite his lies. He is just a self serving, greedy, traitor.

But when it comes to others that actually commit heinous crimes...you get a quick speach that's probably writtenü§î
1058145933253328896 2018-11-01 19:57:04 -0400 <themoosespeaks> @mitchellreports This is bully bullshit. @realDonaldTrump is trying to create a situation so he can use lethal with force without seemingly violating posse comitatus.   He wants the military to shoot. It's an excuse to murder refugees.

The rest of thinking Americans get their information from a wide variety of sources that actually deliver facts not propaganda.
