1118303040241586176 2019-04-16 19:59:56 -0400 <poet_economist> This is @realDonaldTrump’s second veto &amp; the second time he used the veto power to 1) carry out an unconstitutional power-grab from Congress, 2) in order to support deliberate &amp; unnecessary harm against innocent people. Both vetoes might also be technically unconstitutional.
1118303036449808384 2019-04-16 19:59:55 -0400 <yellowdoorhouse> This is nice. But did you know @realDonaldTrump @GOP that 3 black churches in Louisiana were burned down by a white supremacist? Perhaps you could find a few spare dollars to support them?Oh wait: these are *black* churches so that’ll never happen.
