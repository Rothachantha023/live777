936383942378258437 2017-11-30 18:58:23 -0400 <Truth247> @realDonaldTrump was in Missouri yesterday where he LIED about the GOP tax increase for American workers when he said he would be HURT by the plan. If we know nothing else about Trump everyone knows he doesn’t do anything that will hurt Trump. He will save $1 BILLION!
936383942046965767 2017-11-30 18:58:23 -0400 <DrHubaEvaluator> Pathetic that @realDonaldTrump has told thousands of HUGE lies in 2016-7. His supporter base tends to be poorer, less educated, sicker than rest of USA. Trump's policies hurt his base most. Making America Great for rich, corps, investors not poor/middle class. Shame on Trump.

When Boston Mayor Jim Curly said he would fight an opponent in the gutter, one wag said, "you'd have to step up, Jim" . When has Trump ever elevated any discussion about anything?
936383611154194432 2017-11-30 18:57:04 -0400 <dave43210> @realDonaldTrump Good thing President Obama left the economy in such good shape.  It will go into the toilet if this abomination of a tax "reform" plan makes it out of congress. #Impeach45
