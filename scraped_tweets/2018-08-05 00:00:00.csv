He justifies their fear &amp; makes their anger righteous. Everything they have claimed mattered to them in the past was a complete farce, it was always about their fear. Trump tapped that hard and now owns them.

1026255894542213120 2018-08-05 19:57:26 -0400 <dominowski> @realDonaldTrump Which dolt have you been talking to now? Sounds like maybe yourself again. Clearing wooded areas turns relatively cool, damp land under trees into hot, tinder-dry brush.
