NYC is the only city in the NATION which uses a single multiple-choice exam. It's not about race, no child deserves the #SHSAT, but about what's right for all students

1050535097441632257 2018-10-11 19:54:19 -0400 <ulfkastner> @Swerdlick Something to perhaps consider when discussing the relative significance of job growth numbers is that the closer a national economy inches towards full employment, the harder won growth is. Also, I bet the burgeoning gig economy helps @realDonaldTrump's numbers.
