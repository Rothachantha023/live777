In my opinion when he is on the campaign trail his hate speech rises which puts people in danger. He won on stoking the hate &amp; fear in 2016 so he figures it worked then why not do it again.

You fight its release because it doesn't exonerate you. If you fight to keep it hidden, it tells us you are guilty of something. Really. Bigly.

Please do a compare and contrast of @realDonaldTrump comments vs those of...let‚Äôs say, Barack Obama, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, John Clapper, Hillary Clinton, CNN. I could keep going. Once you have done that, hope you will share with us.
1117577231201648641 2019-04-14 19:55:50 -0400 <vin9251> @Peggykurpinski @real_defender @realDonaldTrump I'd like to start a poll of how many people  received a refund last year and years past. And then what happened this year. I'll start.  Since 1991, I always received a refund. This year, I have to pay the IRS bigly.  And the only thing that changed is the laws.

1117577226550218752 2019-04-14 19:55:49 -0400 <ChemPhD1990> @realDonaldTrump With respect Mr #Trump you, the RNC had complete control of the government for 2 years and did nothing about immigration laws.  There was even a deal on the table, but you sabotaged it at the last minute. Then, you created a crisis on the border to boost your campaign. Shameful.
