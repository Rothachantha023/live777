He is not intimidated "a little bit" ...and soon will be bringing all the noise subversives care to "try" and handle...Buck up babies

974434006379921409 2018-03-15 19:55:45 -0400 <Xt1na514> @funder @realDonaldTrump The last part reminds me of the parent thing where when you‚Äôre younger and your mom asks where you‚Äôve been, what you‚Äôve done. At that point you try to lie to her, but she more than likely already knows and wants to see if you will confess. üòÇ
