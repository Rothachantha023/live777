And to continue with any monetary support is ludicrous with consideration to the Palestinians payment for hired criminal actions against Israel and their citizens!

948342457560952832 2018-01-02 18:57:15 -0400 <roguebarkeep> I find it absolutely reprehensible that @realDonaldTrump is calling into question the patriotism and dedication to this country of any career civil servant given the only thing he and his family give a shit about is padding their bank accounts with taxpayers money.
