It has everything to do with right and wrong. DJT has never done anything above board, with the possible exception of pu**y grabbing. The po💩, denounces the Constitution.

Was it wrong? Yes—we need new legislation to fix self-sealing within political families. But the way Trump went about investigating it was also wrong. He used a weird foreign bribe instead of our own intelligence.

1196940713117700096 2019-11-19 18:57:58 -0400 <GoForDW> @jimsciutto @WajahatAli And @Jim_Jordan just said that it was acceptable because in the mind of @realDonaldTrump Ukraine did try to influence the election.
1196940712450899968 2019-11-19 18:57:58 -0400 <Proud19> @B52Malmet I truly believe the BS that @realDonaldTrump is 6’3” &amp; 239 lbs. Oh I also have a bridge 2 sell u if u believe that
1196940712396255232 2019-11-19 18:57:58 -0400 <storz_carla> @BernardKerik @realDonaldTrump They looked at Devin Nunes and said that, yes.
1196940711507251202 2019-11-19 18:57:58 -0400 <BitrTwitr1> @jdickerson @Yahoo Why is the WH giving up so much control? @realDonaldTrump sold us the idea that the US should be getting more than we’re giving since we’re a powerhouse. But “walking away” isn’t forcing anyone to come back begging - it’s only making communism more attractive than our democracy
1196940710181769216 2019-11-19 18:57:58 -0400 <wrsanders45> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews We all know how much you and your Russian sycophants cheat.  Impeachment is real and warranted.  It would help if you were willing to testify in person!!!

1196940708176941056 2019-11-19 18:57:57 -0400 <poormansurvivor> @PressSec @realDonaldTrump The only way for the Democrats to beat President Trump is at the voting booth in November 2020. And based on my research, I believe that it will prove futile

1196940697246420992 2019-11-19 18:57:54 -0400 <SFClearThinker> This just continues to cement the theory that @presssec is quickly become as ridiculously an equal opportunity liar as @realDonaldTrump.   This crime-syndicate administration must be stopped and we can do it. Don't boo. VOTE.  https://t.co/JWeOZ8jrFF

He should just out-genius everyone under oath. Unless everyone is afraid of the lies that will spill out of his open mouth.
1196940694910316544 2019-11-19 18:57:54 -0400 <FreerEleanor> @BernardKerik @realDonaldTrump Yeah, sit this one out, Bernie.  Best yet you keep a low profile.

1196940694398668800 2019-11-19 18:57:54 -0400 <BhamWeekly> haha Gym Jordan @Jim_Jordan keeps making the case that the reason @realDonaldTrump wanted to hold the Ukraine aid was that some former Ukraine officials had criticized Trump personally and opposed his campaign. Of course, that has nothing to do with US national security interests
1196940691865079808 2019-11-19 18:57:53 -0400 <SeanHargraves3> @RyanCoo88764651 @srinirag2000 @PeoplesCourt79 @realDonaldTrump ...or if they have some sort of peaceful mission or it’s a routine deployment of a specific number of personnel. When I was in the military we would have permanently stationed personnel in surrounding countries it was 365 days a year we were not bringing death and destruction
1196940691185840128 2019-11-19 18:57:53 -0400 <DonBarn65727703> @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump I disagree. The whole Republican Party is attaching the witnesses character instead of asking legitimate question. But hey what would I know as a registered Republican. Oh and please get your boy Jim Jordan under control. Never saw a bigger ass clown in my life.

1196940688794906624 2019-11-19 18:57:52 -0400 <rongonz> @realDonaldTrump No president has lied more to the American people than Donald J. Trump. That’s “Changing Washington.”

1196940687901691904 2019-11-19 18:57:52 -0400 <uncredentialed> @jeffpearlman @realDonaldTrump No. And while the impeachment process is completely legitimate, I'd feel more democratic about it to let the voters remove him next year.
1196940686173593601 2019-11-19 18:57:52 -0400 <momofthethings> @Jim_Jordan 1) stop screaming at your witnesses.  2) I'm not sure if you are aware, but the american people don't need Ukraine telling us that @realDonaldTrump is shitty. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry #GOPTraitors
