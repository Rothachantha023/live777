Mongol invasion was successful simply because they outnumber and outmaneuver the guards, and China was in its weak period. Also the mongols were trained army whereas "migrants" who came to US are not. If these migrants come with weapons, then they will get killed as invaders.

1081701579114176512 2019-01-05 18:58:48 -0400 <mckeli24> @realDonaldTrump I think you’re grasping at straws. Knowing that you haven’t accomplished anything in 2 years, the wall is all you have left,

1081701573238145024 2019-01-05 18:58:46 -0400 <David1and82HWY> @realDonaldTrump The idea, sir, is by giving aid you mitigate the conditions that drive people to migrate in the first place, you make America look like the hero it was in the aftermath of WW2, and, at the same time, you make the world a better place. The wall is the opposite of all those things.

1081701317427421184 2019-01-05 18:57:45 -0400 <BaldyRuddRudd> @realDonaldTrump Easy! They realize that $5 billion can buy things that really matter, and see no point in burning a huge sum of money simply because you're afraid of Rush Limbaugh and Anne Coulter.

1081701315900788736 2019-01-05 18:57:45 -0400 <KevinBRoss4> @realDonaldTrump The biggest problem on our southern border is racism. The second biggest could be alleviated by legalizing marijuana. That way people don’t come in contact with meth and heroin dealers as often. What makes marijuana a gateway drug is the connections people make. Eliminate them

1081701313275195394 2019-01-05 18:57:44 -0400 <Ethan_Mawyer> @realDonaldTrump Some of this is because of the drug makers, and some because of insurance. But shouldn't this be discussed with policy advisers, not with Twitter?
1081701307772268544 2019-01-05 18:57:43 -0400 <Mpharns> @realDonaldTrump Trump is asking the wrong people for the money! Wtf is wrong with you supporters? Wall or no wall he promised WE WOULD NOT PAY! YOU DO KNOW WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM IF ANYONE APPROVES IT RIGHT? Or just going along with the #manwholiesallday?

I mean, don’t they both have walls around their homes? If so, why?
