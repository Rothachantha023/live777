1110330238074916864 2019-03-25 19:58:52 -0400 <Jaxson5280> @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC The major reason that the report did not exonerate Trump nor reach any conclusion is the precedents prevent any prosecution of a sitting president.  It does not prevent Congress from investigating a sitting president.

Which in itself exonerates him because in the USA you are 100% innocent until PROVEN guilty!!!

1110329526125543424 2019-03-25 19:56:02 -0400 <TexBrussow> Did someone leak a copy of the report? If NOT what do you have besides conjecture and opinion? Or are you going to spend an hour apologizing to @realDonaldTrump and his supporters?
1110329523793481735 2019-03-25 19:56:02 -0400 <boyl3> @realDonaldTrump @LindaSuhler You’re such a lucky man! Two years of the investigation, Mueller couldn’t decide whether You,Trump obstructed justice or not? He is a prosecutor, does he need AG #Barr to fill the gap for him and let you go free? Mueller, are you #sleeping
1110329522728157185 2019-03-25 19:56:01 -0400 <KrazzyKatty> @realDonaldTrump Meanwhile, all of your real RICO crimes have been passed off to SDNY. Enjoy.

1110329516960956418 2019-03-25 19:56:00 -0400 <ArcherBM> @Sorry_ImNotSrry @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump You claimed that R's did all they could "to obstruct &amp; investigate during Obama yrs". If you can't answer "yes" to the questions I posed, your statement is not true. Dems have been claiming Trump is a Russian agent. That's also a lie. I don't know what FNC has to do w/ this.

In light of today's events, I have changed my mind. Will it take an arrest for #MAGAt's to change theirs for .@realDonaldTrump? #ReleaseFullMuellerReport #RICO #SDNY   https://t.co/JRP75R38lY
1110329505095155713 2019-03-25 19:55:57 -0400 <Rene_gadeCowboy> #ReleaseTheFullMuellerReport this is rich...The guy whose lied over 9k times in two yrs + made up two fake spokesmen to lie to ppl and lied to a bank about his self worth is whining in a letter. Not to mention his kid lied abt trump tower meeting. Suck it up🧁@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/7N89zNIjR5

1110329494592606208 2019-03-25 19:55:55 -0400 <PanthersFanInCO> @TeamPelosi @senatemajldr and @LindseyGrahamSC are doing the same thing they’ve done since 2016: protect @realDonaldTrump and his administration at all costs. They continue to chose #PartyOverCountry
1110329492495650818 2019-03-25 19:55:54 -0400 <ChristineRLord> @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump You are not only a disgrace to Congress but to the American people. Do your job. You've been in Congress forever and have nothing to show that you have done except get rich off taxpayers. Shame, shame, shame on you.
