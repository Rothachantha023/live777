1061407993793732608 2018-11-10 18:59:20 -0400 <SarahBCalif> @ProudResister @realDonaldTrump Trump is No Stamina, Low Energy, a Traitor to the United States and a disgrace to our military and veterans. I prefer my presidents to be faithful to the Constitution and not hand-picked as a puppet for Putin.

1061407991163842560 2018-11-10 18:59:19 -0400 <egwitte> Maybe @realDonaldTrump skipping the memorial today is for the best.  It‚Äôs embarrassing as an American, but imagine how embarrassing it would be if he started talking about his election win and railed against NATO at such a somber event.

Count every legitimate vote, not late postmarked ballots, but all absentee and provisional ballots. Since you idiots are claiming fraud, is there a redo if your guys win anyways? Huh?

1061407682601607168 2018-11-10 18:58:06 -0400 <frankie5563> @DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump Absolutely!
1061407681448235018 2018-11-10 18:58:05 -0400 <JrWilder> @CNN @realDonaldTrump says that caravans are the most ominous threats to America. One question? In the last month, who,has killed more innocent people in America; members of the caravan or members of his number one voting demographic (white men)? Where should he really send the Army?
1061407680621932544 2018-11-10 18:58:05 -0400 <trevstanley> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS What a pathetic coward you are. Imagine if all those US and allied veterans of the two wars had refused to go out into the rain , snow , hurricane , floods to fight so you could spout your vitriolic bollocks? You are a disgrace to your country.
1061407680445603840 2018-11-10 18:58:05 -0400 <Wldrthang19571> @JenniferJJacobs @jaketapper Where there is a will, there is a way.   @realDonaldTrump doesn‚Äôt have the will to honor veterans - even those killed in action. He is a pathetic excuse for a commander-in-chief.   The other world leaders managed to make it there. They found a way.   #HonorOurFallen
1061407679279759362 2018-11-10 18:58:05 -0400 <SpatiallyWired> @MJMcKean @realDonaldTrump I... I... I'm not understanding this strange sensation... I... actually appreciate the words in a trump tweet? I don't trust his motivation tho; must be desperate for all to forget his evils and is casting spells. Fight his will to lull you, America!! Fight!

1061407676268199936 2018-11-10 18:58:04 -0400 <dtwyman> @NSoames @realDonaldTrump In case you are wondering, this is how real men deal with rain.  Real presidents also have this thing called contingency plans, of course planning isn‚Äôt actually a hallmark of this Administration.   PS - Every other world leader managed to get to a cemetery to honor their dead.  https://t.co/TZ2CZWOQYl
1061407675618091015 2018-11-10 18:58:04 -0400 <denise76300> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump can't comprehend giving up anything for anyone!  He lives by "if there is nothing in it for me then I'm out"  proven today!  The soldiers who lost there lives in WWII deserve better than DT anyway!!

1061407673336250369 2018-11-10 18:58:03 -0400 <jaflady> @DBalistrer @realDonaldTrump Way. Way too late. Sitting here under a veil of smoke with ash raining down. Way, way late. We got your 1st message here in CA. It was inhumane, callous and full of lies and wrong info.
