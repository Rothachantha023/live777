Additionally, Republicans had the house from 2010 to 2016, giving them full oversight abilities. They, like the press, came up with nothing on Obama's admin.

It's too disappointing for @realDonaldTrump, as it's well below the 4-6% growth he promised! So @GOP decided to focus on a different measure to make it look a bit better, hence 3.1% was born.

Its only the biased sources like Fox that hide polling data.  This poll says most people like the ECONOMY, only 42% think YOU are doing a decent job, lower than every postwar Potus.
