1025894011536637952 2018-08-04 19:59:27 -0400 <MelisCattish> @realDonaldTrump "its" is the possessive, while "it's" is a contraction.  2 subjects require a plural verb, i.e., "are" not "is". "bad" is an adjective, "badly" is an adverb.  Did you go to grade school?  And after all those mistakes, you then say that a mtg is up to Iran? Way to be in control.

1025893414318075907 2018-08-04 19:57:04 -0400 <SkullCastle> @BBQWeed @realDonaldTrump I think the higher prices will drive down the volume.  Unless income is adjusted to the inflation.  What I would see it more of what we had in 2008-2009.  Cost of delivery will first go up, thus inflating all other market sectors.  The only true way to combat this is to adjust
