1103445121922588672 2019-03-06 18:59:52 -0400 <eugenegu> @realDonaldTrump People who are wrongfully accused of a crime welcome investigations to clear their name. They want the evidence and the facts fully fleshed out so that all the false accusations and smears can go away. But those who are guilty avoid investigations like the plague.

1103445076569546753 2019-03-06 18:59:41 -0400 <Belinda_McBride> @realDonaldTrump Its a shame the POTUS didn't take a stronger stance against anti-semitism following the march in Charlottesville when Neo-Nazis chanted "Jews will not replace us."
1103445076284456961 2019-03-06 18:59:41 -0400 <john_jwinecoff> @realDonaldTrump That's only because they can't decide which crime (among so many) to charge you with
1103445075470753802 2019-03-06 18:59:41 -0400 <DavidAnvil> @realDonaldTrump Uh, there are a number of people accusing you of crimes. Getting the evidence in order is the issue. You have obstructed justice numerous times on this very platform, and you absolutely broke the campaign finance laws.
1103445074568990720 2019-03-06 18:59:41 -0400 <adamdaunyahooc1> @realDonaldTrump The check Cohen provided is proof of a crime while in office

1103445072748728320 2019-03-06 18:59:41 -0400 <Pscc8082> @realDonaldTrump In direct opposition of the Constitution they swore to uphold, protect and defend. The democratic cartel is a group of criminals.

1103445065257676800 2019-03-06 18:59:39 -0400 <H2ODiver> @realDonaldTrump GOP had their chance to do this right the first tine but they caved (under leadership of your flunky @DevinNunes)

1103445060127985665 2019-03-06 18:59:38 -0400 <ToddisaGoodName> @realDonaldTrump You have been accused of several crimes. You just can’t be indicted until you are impeached or the DOJ realizes The Constitution doesn’t say a sitting president can’t be indicted.

1103445052074778624 2019-03-06 18:59:36 -0400 <RogersByers> @realDonaldTrump This whole onslaught against our President is driven by a group inside the liberals. They want to be in power they’re a bunch of power hungry sycophants. It’s a act of treason in my opinion
