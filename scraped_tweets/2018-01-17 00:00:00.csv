If any man spoke to your wife in that manner in front of you how would you react? If defending the abusive man is your answer good luck in divorce court. Also with being a progressive hypocrite.

The article you referenced was better suited for @NationaIEnquire I believe Buckley would be ashamed at the direction NRO has taken. Maligning #Evangelical #Christians is becoming a pastime for the media.

953778461935579136 2018-01-17 18:58:00 -0400 <kay_1773> @realDonaldTrump Remember Chrysler is Italian owned as part of FIAT-Chrysler Automotive, so best to make sure those plants you‚Äôre bringing back to the US from Mexico aren‚Äôt in turn financing Alfa-Romeo and FIAT plants in Europe. Alfa-Romeo has seen a big resurgence of late, with many new models.
