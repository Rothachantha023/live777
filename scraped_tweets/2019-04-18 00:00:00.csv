Actually, he prob thought Donnie was a POS when he was alive. He would be so ashamed of him. The best kind of ashamed. Ashamed better than anyone.

Get over it you're guilty. Just because they don't have specific laws for how you did it doesn't give you a clean slate. Quit trying to convince people otherwise you are a liar!!

1119027527580880896 2019-04-18 19:58:47 -0400 <tcoreagain> @realDonaldTrump If you had a Moral Compass this would be clear to you. When Russians ask you if you want dirt on the opponent the answer is ‚Äúno‚Äù. Then you pick up the phone &amp; call the FBI. They briefed you about meddling &amp; you still didn‚Äôt speak up. You then hid your interactions w/ Russians

Aaron can‚Äôt defend the collusion so he brings @realDonaldTrump into it, that‚Äôs the far left textbook strategy. The far left that wants us to be servants to 612 ers.
