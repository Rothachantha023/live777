1009224303085346816 2018-06-19 19:59:58 -0400 <KopsMiss> @realDonaldTrump The U.S. just withdrew from the UN Human Rights Council while it is actively engaging in government-sanctioned child abuse.  Make no mistake. Donald Trump and his administration are not just committing crimes against humanity. They are committing CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN.

You cannot negotiate with Terrorists. You can stop him and make sure there is  No Wall.  Instead of a wall, use the funds to improve the economies and security of the source countries
