1089674294672719872 2019-01-27 18:59:31 -0400 <SkittlesMcClure> @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Whataboutism - a logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which in the United States is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda.

1089674293007577088 2019-01-27 18:59:31 -0400 <heatherhejduk> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Actually they are name matches and more information has been requested to determine whether they are citizens or not. This is *possible* voter fraud. Ironically, Texas has one of the strongest voter ID laws in the country.
