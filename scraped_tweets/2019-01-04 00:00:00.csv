Thinking back to @ThomasMulcair , is it possible he suddenly quit the Party because his Islamic base switched to Justin? Thinking out loud, nothing more, but it makes sense.

1081339300552282112 2019-01-04 18:59:14 -0400 <BookwrmBiologst> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS   To be clear, the only "national emergency" is #Individual1 (I know you're not big on subtlety, so to be even more clear, that's *YOU*)  The vast majority of Americans don't want your damn wall. Don't worry about "looking foolish" -- that ship has sailed.

If I am not mistaken the 9-11 terrorist used planes to attack us - not asylum seekers crossing thru Mexico.

He has you fooled into thinking it's a big problem. Easy to get around a wall. Most illegal migrants got in our country by air. How high is this all going to be. Trump is making fools out of people.
