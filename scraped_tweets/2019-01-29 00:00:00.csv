This also why the scientists changed the name to Climate Change in the hope it would be better understood, but I kept it simple for you as you haven't made the change. Simon

1090398333917638656 2019-01-29 18:56:36 -0400 <kellam_kim> @AltScalesOfJust @realDonaldTrump Why not? The Bible was taken out of schools and look what has happened? School shootings and suicides.. There are not many roads to heaven. Jesus was the only One who claimed to be God and who rose from the grace. Historical fact. This is a Christian nation founded on Christian..
1090398332797812737 2019-01-29 18:56:35 -0400 <LMarsh66> @realDonaldTrump Who is paying for Christianity to be taught in public schools? Will there be "optional" classes in Buddhism, Shinto, Islam? Don't use my tax dollars to do the job of Sunday school!
