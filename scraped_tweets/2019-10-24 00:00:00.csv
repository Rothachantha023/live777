Trump has a reputation of stiffing hundreds or thousands of people who have done work for him.  He's a criminal and I will be glad to see him have some NY State consequences when this national nightmare is over.

1187518969458188288 2019-10-24 19:59:20 -0400 <MarkEntenberg> @realDonaldTrump Yes, let the Kurds control these fields and earn money from crude oil sales. This will provide capital to them and US will provide less in aid!! Excellent strategy! Also, Kurds will keep The Iranians away and US can check mate them any time of the day!!

Trump will then bash you to death. If that doesn't work he will have AG Barr go and have a secret meeting. Just ask @rupertmurdoch regarding Fox and Shep Smith.
1187518894258282496 2019-10-24 19:59:02 -0400 <MikeDeeHere> @realDonaldTrump This is where you’re wrong, Mr. President.  First, Germany’s economy, as well as other Euro countries, is in poor shape.  Second, interest rates are an important lever that gov can use to stimulate an economy and should be reserved for troubled times.

The Senate should make the threat clear in advance and force their hand in the House.

I think you missed something about Hillary’s clearance and exoneration after your wasted investigation. Classified? You are in Trump’s twilight dumb zone. Stop speeding misinformation. That is why all Republicans are now screwed and their pants burned off. FOX TRUMP is 👎🏼

There are national security issues involved, hence the need for secrecy. 2. This is the same procedure as GOP used in Benghazi classified hearings.
