Medicare does not provide healthcare, only the means to pay for it. GOP makes claims that Medicare for all is government RUN healthcare. It is not, so we need to make sure people understand the difference.

1161427023983763456 2019-08-13 19:59:15 -0400 <MaureenTracy2> @realDonaldTrump @CNN Trump supporters will agree - until there's a crisis &amp; they want up to date news on it. Smart people watch a variety of networks &amp; read a variety of sources to decide what they believe. Bc we have a President who tells lies easily &amp; often (12,000+ since election), we need media.

Simple. Only Republicans would want to hide the sources of their campaign funds. Because there's no way to spin receiving money from, for instance, the NRA. Completely corrupt.
