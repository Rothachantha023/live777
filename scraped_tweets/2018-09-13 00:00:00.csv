1040389498247544832 2018-09-13 19:59:20 -0400 <KidBrightwillow> @SenWarren @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Dems have controlled PR politics 61 out of last 69 years.  Electric utility was barely functioning before hurricanes.  After hurricanes hospitals failed, life sustaining equipment failed, roads remained blocked too long, etc.  Dems are at the heart of this tragedy.

1040389492966928384 2018-09-13 19:59:19 -0400 <PinkElephant67> @realDonaldTrump Don't they deserve to trade (sell) their hard earned goods for good money.  Why should we offer them welfare to make up for your shortfall has a leader?
1040389491503058945 2018-09-13 19:59:18 -0400 <canadiantwit> All @realDonaldTrump had to do for Hurricane Maria was call ret. Lt-Gen  Russel Honore who directed operations during Katrina. He didn't have the brains to do that.

There’s an inconvenient document called Standard Operation Procedure or SOP as we call it. In the case of FEMA it specially said that they act as a gathering center and not a distribution center. Distribution is the state responsibility.

Water from getting off the dock? She's a mayor with local resources, many wiped out by the storm. Trump had the resource of the whole country at his disposal and did almost nothing.
