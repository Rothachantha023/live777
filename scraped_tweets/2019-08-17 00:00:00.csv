1162876036301934592 2019-08-17 19:57:06 -0400 <docohm47> @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump The proud boys are patriotic and proud to be American.  They frown on political correctness as do 80% of Americans now do.  They don't believe in the apology tour Obama took over his 8 years.  America apologizes to no one.  They long for the culture before the left screwed it up.

They say that it takes 2 years for a new President‚Äôs economy to take shape and here we are, on the brink of a recession and we‚Äôve turned our back on most of our allies. I don‚Äôt think ‚ÄúRocking it‚Äù, is the correct term.
