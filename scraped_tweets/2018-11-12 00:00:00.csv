There is no excuse for his outrageous actions. He failed to honor those men, by blaming the rain for his no show, to commemoration of those lost during WW 1. What a disgrace!

I understand why you complained about the rain to that soldier. You have no emotional connection to war and it’s devastating effects on families. That’s because you are not capable of empathy. It doesn’t exist within your being. #Freak

Have their overseas votes been counted? You talk a lot but have a hard time following through w stuff that really matters. Like cemeteries and visit overseas troops.

1062132372190126081 2018-11-12 18:57:45 -0400 <Peter90666913> @RepSwalwell more like @realDonaldTrump 's continual erratic behaviour and fighting with other countries and a Fed that always overshoots, screwing up the worlds markets...

Your policies created the stock market to rise, but the dems are making it fall because of presidential harassment? Is there a cream you can take for that? It sounds bad. I might try calling sick into work tomorrow with presidential harassment.

He's the most pitiful president we've ever had. Nixon at least had the wherewithal to resign from the presidency! #CultureOfCorruption

I’d say we’re doing a hell of a lot better then what’s happening with you folks down there.  https://t.co/oevNm87CKq
1062132208423583747 2018-11-12 18:57:06 -0400 <booboosmommy11> @realDonaldTrump @Pink Dear Mr. President, Come take a walk with me Let's pretend we're just two people  And you're not better than me I'd like to ask you some questions If we can speak honestly How do you sleep while the rest of us cry? How do you dream when a mother
1062132207366688768 2018-11-12 18:57:06 -0400 <patriottj1776> Even more evidence that @realDonaldTrump will never #StopTheSteal &amp; that the socialists have now seized full control of our election process #ZeroFaithInGov

1062132200739627008 2018-11-12 18:57:04 -0400 <TheKerryKnott> @realDonaldTrump “Картинка стоит тысячи слов” which translates to “A picture is worth a thousand words”. What were you thinking at that moment? #justcurious #seriously
1062132200290873350 2018-11-12 18:57:04 -0400 <OlgaUK1> @DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump And his own party!

In trying times like this, Words must be used carefully and emotions controlled maturely. Also, how is a current “trend” (according to your words) history?
1062132191474450434 2018-11-12 18:57:02 -0400 <NickSnydz> @MattWhitaker46 I heard they are trying to indict @jeromecorsi_ , so they can get to #RogerStone and @realDonaldTrump !!! This is a TRAVESTY!!! You have the POWER to STOP THIS NOW! They are stealing elections and falsely accusing our PATRIOTS! You have to step up guy! and NOW!

1062132182913871878 2018-11-12 18:57:00 -0400 <panaidkappa> @realDonaldTrump No sir.  Every vote should be counted legally and fairly.  You dont just get to claim a winner

1062132173342425088 2018-11-12 18:56:58 -0400 <camrusso21> @realDonaldTrump I don't know details of how CA Forest Mgmt functions, but after living in SoCal for 5.5 years, I was shocked by a lot of what I encountered re: CA laws &amp; mgmt. So this doesn't totally shock me. Hell, being PC let new cars be made w/o ashtrays, or even the option for one...in CA?!

They rotate their liars to keep it fresh so the BS he's about to feed you will hold up to no one.   Hey Cory talk about who won the midterms   Where the hell is that dangerous caravan?  #TheRepublicanScamParty

I googled her. You should, too, because, Jesus.  If I ever linked anything that transparently garbage and tried to pass it off as a credible source, I’d burn my account to the ground and go back to programming in BASIC.
