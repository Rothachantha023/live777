1106705806936948736 2019-03-15 19:56:40 -0400 <Ciecwicz> It is amazing how @realDonaldTrump accomplishes his agenda by following all the laws and policies and legally working for the American people and still continues to be blocked and obstructed. But when the previous president did everything unconstitutional and illegal, it was fine
