Actually admits not informing superiors of relevant info, instead getting w/ small group of FBI insiders (McCabe included) where they decided to hold information to see how they could use it later. In other words, planned to blackmail @POTUS

All I‚Äôm saying is whenever you have an account contradicted by its original teller, the whole thing is tainted, thereby tainting your entire argument. If you wish to convince, leave out bad examples. You have sooo many good ones to use.

975521150296993792 2018-03-18 19:55:41 -0400 <Larrycalkins9> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I understand from a reputable source that Trump was born in Germany. As such he is not a US Citizen and should be deported. Where is ICE when you really need them?

975521132123164674 2018-03-18 19:55:36 -0400 <TarynStanford> .@realDonaldTrump You might want to read Comey's book - it'll show you why you will never be on the same level as President Obama. You're a pretender and a traitor. We need you in prison and a restoration of the American values you've crapped all over.  https://t.co/P7Y7lix4sG

975521121591275520 2018-03-18 19:55:34 -0400 <MerrylJill> @realDonaldTrump OK, u say McCabe didn't take notes, but we should call them fake memos?Memos that don't exist are fake?!?   BTW, taking notes after a meeting, to memorialize what was said and/or transacted, is standard op for professionals. But what would u know about being professional?

That makes him possibly complicit, definately compromised.  He isnt doing this because he is ethical, he is doing this to cover his own deeds.
