1007774170044862465 2018-06-15 19:57:40 -0400 <peterbriggs> @realDonaldTrump "Great relationship".  That explains the scathing comments she made about you afterwards.  Seriously, nobody believes you anymore, Chicken Orange.

You are by far the worst thing to happen to this country and YOU WILL BE STOPPED.   Your Regime of hatred and white supremacy and  environmental pillaging will end

Since no information of your meetings with russian nationals came out before election. Unlike Comey coming out against Hilary.   Stop being so thin skinned, you‚Äôll never measure up to othe despots that way
1007774162948157440 2018-06-15 19:57:38 -0400 <LisaMitschke> @realDonaldTrump Angela Merkel published it herself. Her own statements contradicts you.
