1201651722126577665 2019-12-02 18:57:50 -0400 <OhIAmPositive> @realDonaldTrump Your relentless, repetitive tweeting may convince your cult of your innocence, but anyone with half a brain can see through your act. Also, you are more radical than anyone, and quite frankly the majority of people are praying for your impeachment.

And even then, you are stacking up a single, mono-faceted graph against a tsunami of data that indicates the opposite.   It‚Äôs like looking at the one panel on a wrecked car and saying ‚ÄúSee, it‚Äôs fine!‚Äù
