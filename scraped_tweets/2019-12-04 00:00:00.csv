They are either clueless to the facts or they are fake bot/paid accounts trying to get people to think you did something wrong. We know better Mr President and we are not fooled!  MAGA!!
1202376860895629314 2019-12-04 18:59:17 -0400 <Jaesa20> @realDonaldTrump Agreed!! Everyone needs to leave him alone.
1202376860891598853 2019-12-04 18:59:17 -0400 <DDuffy54> @Vltreece @SteveGuest @realDonaldTrump Were you outraged when Andrea Tantaros said this on Fox news? "at 15 years old, is the Obama daughter, Malia, going to go on birth control?"   Were you? What she said was true. Trump is not a King. He cannot create  a "Baron"  He is bound by the Constitution.

1202376849822797825 2019-12-04 18:59:14 -0400 <74Opinions> @realDonaldTrump Media showed a videos of others  countries mocking Trump! They showed Trump unable to answer basic questions.

He wants to run and hide like he did today while NATO was still gathered.  You're on a sinking ship, McCarthy.

Of course they came to their conclusions before the hearing. Reps didn't change their minds. EG a psychologist not to have made mind up about a murderer before a trial?

1202376735465123840 2019-12-04 18:58:47 -0400 <possibility_new> Kellyanne Conway &amp; George Conway are very smart   It's hard for me to continue to believe this tense game is nothing more than hedging their bets &amp; gaining notoriety in the process, which always monetizes &amp; will secure a career for a Conway beyond the @realDonaldTrump terms!!

1202376705580716032 2019-12-04 18:58:40 -0400 <ShopgirlAlic> @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump The Senate isn't going to convict and remove. Trump will claim he's totally exonerated (regardless of being impeached) and we'll have to defeat him at election time, which we all know won't be fair. I'm all for impeachment but Repubs are too dug in now to relent, at any cost.
