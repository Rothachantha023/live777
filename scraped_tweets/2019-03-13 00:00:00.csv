1105981636171042816 2019-03-13 19:59:04 -0400 <notimetobl33d> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews So an investigator was appointed to prove/unprove your involvement/manipulation with Russia.  Isn't that what an investigation is for? Keep tooting your horn. Your whole empire/legacy/family is all done like a dinner.
