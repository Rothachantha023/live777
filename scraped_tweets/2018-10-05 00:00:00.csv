1048361934444265472 2018-10-05 19:58:57 -0400 <bklynbanished> By attacking the motives of women who accuse men of sexual predation, @GOP and @realDonaldTrump give license to such attacks and a defense to the perpatrators.  By their own actions they make sexual assault and violence against women acceptable behavior.

Hoping that @WalshFreedom will take on Duckworth in a rematch at the Senate level in a few years.  Definitely a counter-puncher.  What say you, Joe?

What she has cited as appropriate behaviour is related to a Justice that has already been seated - not a nominee fighting for his life's reputation. Just stupid.

R's obstruction is unprecedented. We will see if D's have the fortitude in Nov.  If not, we deserve what we get

1048361194141057025 2018-10-05 19:56:00 -0400 <jmontagna4> @ABCPolitics @ABC I don’t believe “facts” have EVER come out of @realDonaldTrump mouth. He can’t tell the truth when he has good things to say, let alone when he is mocking the victims of sexual assault. What a piece of garbage trump is.
1048361193059102720 2018-10-05 19:56:00 -0400 <papijones4> @britin17k @realDonaldTrump Thanks brother.

1048361185131679744 2018-10-05 19:55:58 -0400 <jilly_bean_08> @realDonaldTrump I don't think someone under investigation (i.e. YOU) should be allowed to nominate someone to the Supreme Court.

1048361155209695232 2018-10-05 19:55:51 -0400 <Butcherguy2> @ProudResister @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump was the first President to support same sex marriage BEFORE he was elected.
1048361154035240961 2018-10-05 19:55:51 -0400 <BettySpeaks2020> @newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump All I see is "more proof" that DJT hasn't screwed up the trending numbers he inherited from the previous Administration. You know ... OBAMA.
1048361139447504896 2018-10-05 19:55:47 -0400 <Monarchmom2> @realDonaldTrump The entire process is corrupt since McConnell and the republican party decided they could do whatever. Stolen elections when the majority lose's, asking for help and getting it from Russia. The frosting on the cake is the idiot president.
1048361137694113792 2018-10-05 19:55:47 -0400 <MagusCP> Someone should tell President @realDonaldTrump that a true leader would tell his supporters not to engage in such tactics. The Republican Senators likewise should distance themselves from this kind of smear campaign if they truly had the interests of their country at heart.
1048361132572991488 2018-10-05 19:55:46 -0400 <Jfuspo> Lets show @SenatorCollins that we want her to vote NO on Kavanaugh. Pledge to this campaign. If she votes for @realdonaldtrump 's pick your money will go to fund her future opponent. #StopKavanaugh #BeAHero  https://t.co/pZlN4SclU3
1048361132468162560 2018-10-05 19:55:46 -0400 <BcFriday1> @ABC @TheView So #SenatorCollins is okay with the fact that @realDonaldTrump wrote @BrettKavanaugh statement for the hearing. Yep, that impartiality 👎

1048361122544402432 2018-10-05 19:55:43 -0400 <kickstart526> @ProudResister @realDonaldTrump Extremely emotional and deflective post. What did LGBTQ have to do with today?  Ford was never silenced she was heard and and given platform to speak.  She had 0 evidence.  Democracy overruled the nonsense.  America won today.

1048361098246803457 2018-10-05 19:55:38 -0400 <pamla7777> @realDonaldTrump 7x and not once did he take a lie detector test which Kavanaugh himself said should be mandatory in a background check! He refused because he knew it was a felony when he lied again!
1048361097311477760 2018-10-05 19:55:37 -0400 <nomiwest> @realDonaldTrump So, then, it should be deduced that you are also saying that all of those identical signs at YOUR ongoing campaign rallies are in the hands of paid participants?? Good to know. Thank you for that clarification. Are you paying for their votes as well??

1048361036330545153 2018-10-05 19:55:23 -0400 <bladimz> I suspect that @realDonaldTrump is so skilled at the concept of cruelty because he experienced that and humiliation on a regular basis as far back in his life as a little toddler.  Just an educated guess.  #CrueltyAndHumiliation  #Coward #Bully #ToiletPaperOnHisShoe
1048361030475243520 2018-10-05 19:55:21 -0400 <abmartin3045> @realDonaldTrump they are made by the same company that made your "FAKE SIGNS " and paid people to attend your rallies and clap and yell on cue. I think those are "FAKE PEP RALLIES" using green screen  technology.

Yet you continue to insult and demean those who were brave enough to speak their truth about sexual assault. This country is split/hurt and you continue to create new wounds by picking the scabs. It’s time for a better man.

Don't expect a vote from me when it comes time for re-election.
