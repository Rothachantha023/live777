Your lying daughter, who can somehow best Conway’s “alternative facts”, your dog-killing son, and most of all a man who can call himself a minister out of one side of his mouth and then support trump who could not care less about this country from the other.

How do you "obstruct" a crime that never happened in the first place? @realDonaldTrump went to his advisors to see what he should do moving forward. The waste  of taxpayers money proved NO collusion. The rest is up to the AG. #CollusionDelusion
