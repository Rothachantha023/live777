1101994295727407105 2019-03-02 18:54:48 -0400 <CanuckCognizant> @Tennesseine @realDonaldTrump Yet nothing gets said, let alone done about it. Trump breaking the law is apparently the norm and allowed. Obama would have been impeached 10 times over by now. FFS Bill Clinton was removed over a blow job, yet Trump can do whatever he wants.
