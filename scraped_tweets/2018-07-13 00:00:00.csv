1017920926078337024 2018-07-13 19:57:15 -0400 <vinnielopes> The 2018 #GOP platform is simple and pathetic:  ‚Äî Defend @realDonaldTrump at all costs, no matter what.  This was once a party that fought for decency in the community and having a small, fair and efficient government. It‚Äôs sad how the party got hijacked.
