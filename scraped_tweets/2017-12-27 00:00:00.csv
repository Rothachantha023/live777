She won the big states, yes but not the majority of the country. The poles out are fr your friend CNN which of course are inaccurate. Anything else?

946167973898792960 2017-12-27 18:56:38 -0400 <luffdee> @mrsopinionated @AidenHatfield @realDonaldTrump I feel you have a very sad view of the world.  Religions can co-exist anywhere with the right attitude.  And all three of these are founded on the same Abrahamic texts and traditions.  So why not?   Why are we here if not to make the world better.
946167973630312448 2017-12-27 18:56:38 -0400 <Malibu367> @realDonaldTrump I wonder if this POS even knows or cares that California is still burning.

946167964952281088 2017-12-27 18:56:36 -0400 <bes5020> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfrlends Judge in Washington up to no good things again. Think Dems are teaching immigrants to have one family member come to US and at some pt say, now I need my family. US needs to say, then leave &amp; go back to your family. Should be illegal to play these immigrant games, costly to US.

Again, and again and again. It would be as if i said All GOP are sexual predators and racists. Every single one of them!!! /facepalm.
