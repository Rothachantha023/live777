It's because of Trumps trade conflict with China that now causes Iowa to suffer financially let alone all other states. If his intention is to bankrupt the US, then he's going to have problems.

1141495047059333120 2019-06-19 19:56:41 -0400 <wowwgran> @funder @realDonaldTrump I propose we respond to those who say "Democrat Party" by calling them the "Publican Party," referring to the New Testament tax collectors.

There are no kids in cages, taxes were lowered not raised.

1141495037425082368 2019-06-19 19:56:39 -0400 <JnrPhotog> @realDonaldTrump K Tel called.  They'd like to put your next vintage throwback Trump rally on a vinyl record.  Denny Terrio and the Dance Fever dancers would like to be the opening act.  The Solid Gold dancers will be the finale!! 😐
