964288158920622080 2018-02-15 18:59:47 -0400 <TekavecCarol> @realDonaldTrump Ban AR-15 guns and high capacity magazines! That would do more to honor the victims than words on a page or yet another lowerd flag.

I think for a first step you need to put yourself in the situation of these victims. Take it seriously and sit down in a classroom, with actual students, perhaps even some survivors, and go through a live active shooter drill.

THIS IS ALL ON YOU..your fault because of your greed and zero understanding or compassion, I want a real president.

Every year we send millions to Mexico for Federal and Military Aid, cut that off until we have enough to pay for the wall.

964287562083782656 2018-02-15 18:57:25 -0400 <MaxwellMudd> @ThomasJosephMil @JackieSharp @realDonaldTrump I'm aware of that. Are you aware that training &amp; multiple types of testing are required to get a driver's license, which is required to operate a vehicle? Where's the analog for guns? Cars aren't guns. You make a good argument for requiring more than a driver's license for a gun.

964287560494256129 2018-02-15 18:57:24 -0400 <EvanCull> @EClark777 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump the total process to significantly lower firearms related homicide takes about 10 years on average.

964287553888313344 2018-02-15 18:57:23 -0400 <mchughkj95> @realDonaldTrump The A rifle has done enough damage. Ban them again for another 20 years. I know the 1990s are gone but the LAW worked. I enjoy firearms like the rest and we should keep our firearms. YOU Don‚Äôt need an A rifle that shoots 20plus bullets in seconds
964287552550326273 2018-02-15 18:57:22 -0400 <myaiswhoiam> @realDonaldTrump You are a pathetic hypocrite. You are complicit. One of your first actions as POTUS was to eliminate the laws making it harder for mentally ill persons to buy guns put into place by President Obama.  You are a disgrace to decent Americans.
964287552365711360 2018-02-15 18:57:22 -0400 <99_weeks> It's true, @realDonaldTrump is a walking, talking contradiction of himself. Just a fee hours ago he stood at a podium &amp; claimed the Parkland HS shooter was mentally I'll, the a short time later he did this quietly. Why @PressSec? We want answers!   https://t.co/HiUKjt261n
