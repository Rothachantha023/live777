1140408711183306758 2019-06-16 19:59:59 -0400 <RetiredBoomer55> @realDonaldTrump They are considering your impeachment, because you have committed numerous high crimes and misdemeanors.  The details are in our Constitution and are definitely legal.  You should have someone explain the process to you.

The criminal organization known as the "Republican" party will of course support the Drumpf, but that matters little. Approaching impeachment as a mathematical asymptote is the best approach. The Drumpf will self-destruct.

1140408594292256768 2019-06-16 19:59:31 -0400 <SarahLongwell25> @julianzelizer @realDonaldTrump It depends on who the nominee is. Which raises the question, how many Democrats have learned the lesson of 2016 and will call on Dem candidates to moderate and appeal to more Americans to win in 2020? It feels like Dems could do a smidge more soul searching after losing to Trump.

I actually argued in a paper in my psychology class that autism spectrum disorders which are in Axis V, I believe belong on Axis II with personality disorders or vice versa.
