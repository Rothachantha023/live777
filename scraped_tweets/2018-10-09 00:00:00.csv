1049811737585672192 2018-10-09 19:59:57 -0400 <StaceyTrek> @GOP @senatemajldr Projection is a Kremlin Active Measures ploy.  Accuse other side of that for which you are guilty. Note use of word Mob. BTW, @realDonaldTrump why was your server talking to Russian server leading up to 2016 election?  Stolen data-washing &amp; backchanneling?  https://t.co/F2pjNW2aVi

1049811527245725698 2018-10-09 19:59:07 -0400 <GardenSage> @ddale8 Right.  Democrats have a mob mentality. These rallies are nothing but a rabid mob stirred up by @realDonaldTrump
1049811527023452161 2018-10-09 19:59:07 -0400 <Liberal_Top_Dog> @KeelinMadden @OtagOnline @TrumpsNation45 @realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes @GOPLeader @CA_DMV The biggest obstacle to voter registration has always been TRANSPORT. For poor people who don't have a car, getting transport to the DMV is difficult. For black people, all of the DMV's in their area have been shut down by Repubs. So, they would need transport to a distant DMV.
1049811526528507904 2018-10-09 19:59:07 -0400 <fooye06> Interesting that @realDonaldTrump cancelled his campaign rally right before Hurricane Florence, but is going ahead with tonight’s rally ahead of Hurricane #Michael.....

Scott gutted the FL Dept of Environmental Protection, its' enforcement division &amp; water management districts (who keep contaminants out of the water). Without management, increased nutrient pollution fed the algae blooms.
1049810932405293057 2018-10-09 19:56:45 -0400 <fedupsick> @realDonaldTrump Sir Don, Simple question.  Why wouldn't AG be directly involved in finding out if his DAG made statement about recording you &amp; invoking the 25th to get rid of you?  That direct duty does not interfere with ANY ongoing investigation.  Does AG just quit &amp; keep job?

No new reporting on the tax fraud - is anyone talking to the kav witnesses FBI didn't interview?  sheesh
1049810763559444480 2018-10-09 19:56:05 -0400 <ProjectXConstru> @realDonaldTrump Clinton‘s seem to think that there is something else, mocking reality?

1049810748447297536 2018-10-09 19:56:01 -0400 <EleanorGamgee> I suspect that in childhood, @realDonaldTrump often heard the words he's telling Kavanaugh: "I am so sorry the mean woman tried to tell you that it's wrong to do whatever you want to do. Of course, you can." Poor spoiled brats.

Something happened to Ford, just not Kavanaugh.  4 witnesses, no collaboration.  I pray no one in your family is considered guilty until you prove him innocent.
