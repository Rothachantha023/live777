1020458172887121920 2018-07-20 19:59:22 -0400 <okawesum> @realDonaldTrump Funny, how the NFL and the national anthem are the least of our worries at this moment.  Just a bullshit diversion from current events.

I think siding with a thug like Putin over the United States government is a lot less patriotic than kneeling during the anthem to protest oppressive assholes like you. Listen to any good tapes lately?

Trump put up the white flag and trashed his country in his rush to appease Putin. Gotta hand it to Putin though, he knew exactly how to manipulate Trump.
