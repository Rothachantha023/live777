A trade surplus (a surplus in the balance of trade) occurs when the value of a country's exports exceeds that of its imports. A trade deficit (also called a trade gap) occurs when imports exceed exports.

Trump says 12,000 ppl were seated, 'there are 12,000 seats, we had 12,000 ppl there". "Tht venue MAX's out at roughly 9,000" says fire marshal. Officials say roughly 5,000 ppl shwd-up, NOT 12,000

1002338243592024064 2018-05-31 19:57:14 -0400 <theresap1031> @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Definition of trade surplus/deficit. A trade surplus (a surplus in the balance of trade) occurs when the value of a country's exports exceeds that of its imports. A trade deficit (also called a trade gap) occurs when imports exceed exports.
