966461920835350528 2018-02-21 18:57:32 -0400 <BOOBSPACE> I am disgusted at the "solutions" that @realDonaldTrump concocted in his "remember to say I Hear You" session today. Teachers are paid educators, not assassins or security guards. Parents should not have to choose schools by their "impressive arsenals."  #ParklandStudentsSpeak  https://t.co/yW9lUlInKp

Then the next thing will be that some little kid gets ahold of it or they accidentally shoot a kid? My husband carries daily, and he doesn't think it's a good idea either. He also says #BanAssaultWeapons

Do you think that meeting will defang the marches?  I don‚Äôt believe the concerns were addressed and if they had planned well, it could have deflected the issues.  Now sadly, I think we are going to have a lot of marches and GOP lost a great opportunity.
966461906570670080 2018-02-21 18:57:29 -0400 <easilydissolved> @CBSNews So, in other words, you want guns in the classroom, despite saying that you didn't last year.   Good talk, @realDonaldTrump.

966461788127625216 2018-02-21 18:57:00 -0400 <GayleWATKINS14> @RealDonaldTrump: The NRA has a huge membership and can get involved in protecting school children.  NRA Members could be Checked Out and Certified to be an "NRA School Protection Force" member.  This would also help the NRA gain support and popularity with Liberals. @VP  @GOP

And if you're talking to conservatives, are you just afraid of the fact our president has the balls the improve our country? He's the best president we've had in a long time.

Some need to defend themselves. You must differentiate between the two. I favor "red-flag" laws that would imprison and take the guns from ANYONE violent.
