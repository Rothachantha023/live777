980595282357473280 2018-04-01 19:58:28 -0400 <MarioAV769> @tiredAmerican16 @realDonaldTrump That's how immigration is counted. You can't just count those who come. That's like you wanting to use only birth rates to show population size but leave out death rates.
980595278452371456 2018-04-01 19:58:27 -0400 <AltFactsMurph> @realDonaldTrump America should have kicked your grandfather out when Germany expelled him in 1905 for dodging the draft. That‚Äôs how you became our nightmare. Resign.

I'm sure there are other charts that estimate of how many they think crossed. But again you only have half the equation. If 10 people from Guatemala cross but 20 Guatemalans leave. Then that's a net negative of 10.
