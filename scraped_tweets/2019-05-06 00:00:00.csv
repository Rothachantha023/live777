But he is like a simplistic pie in the sky version of Elizabeth Warren. But alas sexism exists in the Democratic party too and being wonkish isn't as marketable as simplicity.

1125549869685407744 2019-05-06 19:56:15 -0400 <Juni0rLancaster> I think @realDonaldTrump should get an extension on his term for all the "Presidential Time" he spends watching Fox &amp; Friends and listening to Sean Hannity. Its only fair.

Fox News legal analyst Judge Napolitano &amp; the 370 prosecutors hv more than 8000 yrs of legal experience combined bearing down on the issue of Trump's obstruction detailed in Vol. 2.
1125549866371780608 2019-05-06 19:56:14 -0400 <johnabev> For Fear of Barr, Ms. @KimStrassel? I don't think so. It's clear @realDonaldTrump and his @GOP enablers, including pundits such as yourself, fear Mueller's testimony. (Because he's going to say only DOJ policy prevented him from indicting.)
