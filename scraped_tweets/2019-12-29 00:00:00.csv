An example would be the president's words against Rep. Dingell who recently passed away.

They didn't ask about the torch event, because there was no violence that happened that Friday night. The lying leftist lynch mob never gets tired of lying.

He was right. FISA illegal permits proved it. Maybe you might wait for facts. He's been right several times before about such things.

There's more than one candidate still running &amp; there's definitely still women in that running.
