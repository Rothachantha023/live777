Hey, remember when Cohen testified about how Donny wanted him to try to have polls rigged in his favor? I do. I remember because I thought it was so ironic since Donny always talked about fake polls and such. Good times.

1116127876934295552 2019-04-10 19:56:37 -0400 <mdjohns5> @realDonaldTrump @netanyahu 2 corrupt to the core frauds - #trump and #netanyahu.  Both utterly disgraceful.  Shame on the people of #israel and the #USA for putting these #Frauds and #ConMen in office. #IsraelElections2019
1116127876439523328 2019-04-10 19:56:37 -0400 <SapphireWarGirl> @2runtherace @realDonaldTrump Too cool! (Once worked for a company who used him for spoke's person--sales sky rocketed)

1116127875521032193 2019-04-10 19:56:36 -0400 <LesherRetha> @Save_Them_All_ @realDonaldTrump @PeacefulConserv Where does it say they ARE NOT REQUIRED to provide medical care for live births? A botched abortion, I assume you mean the fetus is alive. The 2002 Act covers every possible way 2 be declared alive, down to heartbeat in umbilical cord. It is murder not to.

1116127872194838528 2019-04-10 19:56:36 -0400 <Nenafromsweden> @realDonaldTrump now they are 18.. when did you jump from 13..  @AshaRangappa_ To recap: Barr is opening an investigation into whether the FBI opened an investigation with no evidence based on no evidence that the FBI actually did anything wrong. Is...is that right?

1116127864175452160 2019-04-10 19:56:34 -0400 <NicoleLock1> @realDonaldTrump Some people just love to see a train wreck
1116127859142275072 2019-04-10 19:56:32 -0400 <surfgranma> Apparently @realDonaldTrump isn’t the only crook Papa Trump raised.
1116127859087761408 2019-04-10 19:56:32 -0400 <SavionWinter> @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump He's trying to establish fruit of the poisonous tree and get the evidence against him disallowed.  That's why he kept saying oranges.  He was thinking orange trees because he'd associated that with the phrase. That was what was heavy on his mind.

1116127852447977472 2019-04-10 19:56:31 -0400 <TessDeco> @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump It feels like there's a lot of corruption in Congress too. It feels like Democrats made a slimy deal with the complicit GOP to let Trump walk. I don't think America will trust this Congress again. Too many lies. Democrats get rich off GOP tax scams too. Greed first. Sad America.
