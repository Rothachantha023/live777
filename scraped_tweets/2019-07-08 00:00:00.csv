They are all citizens now. They came here legally just like the asylum seekers are from Central America. There’s No line skipping, it’s a legal court process.

Wrong, it was @BarackObama. Trump and @GOP cut government payments to civilian medical which limits choices. #VeteransAgainstTrump

1148381089163071489 2019-07-08 19:59:22 -0400 <dred_fusion> @realDonaldTrump Such irony! The Trump-hater evangelists  are making Trump among the most popular persons in history. This will greatly enhance his electability for a second term. Literally, night and day, Mr. Trump lives in their mind like a teenage infatuation. Hate is simply perverted love.
