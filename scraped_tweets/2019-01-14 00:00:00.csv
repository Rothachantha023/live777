Lolololol so fucking stupid

I'm not American, but in 2016  I too would have voted for D.J. Trump, as the alternative(2)

He did not equate Trump with Hitler.  He ‚Äúwarned the conditions that prompted Hitler‚Äôs rise to power in Nazi Germany are not unlike those that delivered Trump to the Oval Office in 2016‚Äù.  Huge difference!

You want to be on all of the TV talk shows, especially @FoxNews, but you don't have shit to say about this. And where are @realDonaldTrump, @senatemajldr, @marcorubio,
