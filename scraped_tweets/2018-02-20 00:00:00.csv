966099347434860544 2018-02-20 18:56:48 -0400 <joanneverson1> I just signed this petition for common sense gun control started by a #MSDStrong student. @realDonaldTrump + @marcorubio are you listening? #NeverAgain  https://t.co/h7FSvohhok
966099347053076480 2018-02-20 18:56:48 -0400 <2xPlusGud> @realDonaldTrump In your opinion, when will our wages go up? Will it be before our tax breaks expire?
966099345882865664 2018-02-20 18:56:47 -0400 <DiorEmperor> @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm just relieved that the office for president has term limits, thank God you will only last so long, and you will forever remain a constant reminder and proof of American stupidity..... #EventuallyYouWillBeGone

966099338794594306 2018-02-20 18:56:46 -0400 <DioneSmith13> @RubioNerubio @jerome_corsi @CudaSharon @realDonaldTrump Patriots voted him in, and if he EVER did that, we would vote him out! Lol. But the answer to your question is...ABSOLUTELY! The liars would make up some saving grace story for Obama doing it, like they ALREADY dis, while convicting  Trump of treason...AGAIN!
966099333585125376 2018-02-20 18:56:45 -0400 <Giocruxthenew> @realDonaldTrump So you support voices being suppressed as long as you get your way not surprising
966099328493375488 2018-02-20 18:56:43 -0400 <SkaletUpsetter> @realDonaldTrump You refused to implement sanctions that were voted on 98-2. The only thing you're tougher on is your own cock you self-obsessed pile of shit
