1192591938375049216 2019-11-07 18:57:30 -0400 <MayraOHiggins> @realDonaldTrump Please you do get an attorney, problem is your attorney is also in question.
1192591936865144833 2019-11-07 18:57:29 -0400 <djmedialab> @FondellJoel @heytana @LindaSuhler @DonaldJTrumpJr @kimguilfoyle @realDonaldTrump @TheView @FondellJoel, thanks for digging up the clip and putting it into context. Bejar was still correct to say she was not in blackface. We can all judge how appropriate the costume was but claim that "the View EXPLODES when @DonaldJTrumpJr exposes Joy Behar" is an overreach.
1192591935220924421 2019-11-07 18:57:29 -0400 <Sinfire> @realDonaldTrump Do you have proof that the story is Fake?  Hopefully, you are not expecting America to believe a Compulsive Liar !!!!
1192591931106304000 2019-11-07 18:57:28 -0400 <1houseofmirth> @elianatrue @realDonaldTrump The worst president in history. He’s killing NATO

1192591928954642432 2019-11-07 18:57:27 -0400 <Msdesignerlady> @tomiahonen @MikeBloomberg may be the catalyst to move more voters to the Democratic party who may be on the fence and because he has direct knowledge of working with @realDonaldTrump he could be of significant value.
1192591928874815488 2019-11-07 18:57:27 -0400 <resistdrump> @PsychoHouse11 It must be horrible to be outed publicly @realDonaldTrump for being such scum. I’m sad to see the settlement was only $2M. Karma will be much higher I’m sure. 🔥

1192591926173880322 2019-11-07 18:57:27 -0400 <bonhoefferchild> @NydeanLoL @MattWalshBlog @realDonaldTrump I appreciate your sentiment and I respect you as well.  But I really do feel there is a difference between the two cases.  Prince Andrew is a nobody in our system.  K was tapped to a lifetime appointment in the highest court of the land.  Large difference.

They say Bloomberg would pass out if he had to live on Trump family income. Ha!  He also bought the best seats in all the fine dining restaurants in NYC. #trumpmoneyisforvlowns
1192591898294325249 2019-11-07 18:57:20 -0400 <BubbaClaudius> The Trump camp is horribly desperate at this point.  Look at all the mid-direction they flood the media with.  DonJr. and his silly little book of nonsense..everything under the sun but Daddy's deep troubles.  EXTORTION is what I call it.  Right @realDonaldTrump ?

You only care about your base, you should be the President of all of us. You cause all the hate by calling only your followers patriots. I am a Veteran and a patriot, but you could not catch me dead at one of your whining, complaining HATE rallies.
