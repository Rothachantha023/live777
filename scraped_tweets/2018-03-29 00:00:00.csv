I can attest, however, from personal experience (1967) as a law student tending bar at a Big Shot event at Boalt Hall (Berkeley), that the Chief enjoyed a scotch or two, BEHIND the bar with us students.

He has been all over the tabloids for decades.   We voted for him because dispite his short comings he honestly cares about America and it's citizens.   So we don't have to make excuses. He is doing a great job.

979507711242096640 2018-03-29 19:56:51 -0400 <outraged01> @realDonaldTrump You know government projects are paid for by American taxes? So, it's hard to complain about high taxes AND a lack of government programs. Also hard to complain about nation building while hiring a guy who openly calls for forcible regime change. But you make it look easy.
979507710302408704 2018-03-29 19:56:51 -0400 <Cloudydays1416> @realDonaldTrump Now you are a public servant, and thanks to Amazon the postal service is where it is today. Since, you are working selflessly to help the people, you should be happy about that. You might even consider other retailers contracting with the Post Office.

The only reason they can is because of the revenue stream they have from other industries and markets. Mom and pop or regional companies can’t operate that way. To call it a loss leader is disingenuous.

979507671085801472 2018-03-29 19:56:41 -0400 <JazzCrawler> @realDonaldTrump Actually Amazon is helping to keep our post offices open.

979507534930370561 2018-03-29 19:56:09 -0400 <gailhennessey> Trump chides Obama for court vacancies, thanking him for the "present". Sad to have someone in the WH that doesn't let facts get in his way. Reality is the REPUBLICANS refused to approve of President Obama's judges /SC pick. Ridiculous remarks from @realdonaldtrump continue.
