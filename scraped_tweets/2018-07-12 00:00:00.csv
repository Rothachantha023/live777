Finally a President willing to call out Canada, Germany, Italy, France and others for not contributing their fair share. They want the USA to protect them while they complain about us. @realDonaldTrump #MAGA  https://t.co/WnvmduhERc

1017558232871686146 2018-07-12 19:56:02 -0400 <LadyBleach> @thehill @realDonaldTrump most people don’t like you because you only care about yourself and you should insincere concern, which you hide terribly

1017558220343250945 2018-07-12 19:55:59 -0400 <the_tweetle> @realDonaldTrump You're not excellent. Just thought you should know that going forward. Maybe write it on your (tiny little) palm so you don't forget. "Not excellent" then draw an arrow pointing at you. Kim doesn't think you're excellent. You're not.

1017558200160280577 2018-07-12 19:55:54 -0400 <ivanlbial> @realDonaldTrump stood in front of his last rally and told his fans that Korea returned 200 bodies from the Koran war—it was a flat out lie. Korea snubbed the team sent to receive the bodies. And not word from @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @ffweekend @seanhannity or @TomiLahren #maga  https://t.co/aObglZWIEO
1017558197458984961 2018-07-12 19:55:54 -0400 <MadisonBeebee> @realDonaldTrump North Korean delegation did not show up at planned meeting with U.S. at Demilitarized Zone Thursday to discuss repatriating remains of Americans killed in Korean War. There was no call or explanation.

1017558142413099008 2018-07-12 19:55:41 -0400 <Roelandpaul> @bbcquestiontime @piersmorgan @realDonaldTrump In the EU the UK has the lowest % of people trusting the press despite the BBC. Only 30% trust the press. Worst of all there is no plan of improving this. For me the UK is a sick and unattractive country with such poor press. It makes people being uninformed. #Brexit

Now we have a "POTUS" &amp; GOP that defends &amp; kow tows adversary Russia/Putin , apathetically let's our people divide, &amp; watches our Democracy erode.

George W Bush &amp; #Obama pressed NATO allies 2 ⬆️ military spending. Individual military budgets frm allied countries don’t flow in2 NATO. Gas is &gt;20% Germany’s energy mix.
