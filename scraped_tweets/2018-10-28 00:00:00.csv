1056695995613003777 2018-10-28 19:55:32 -0400 <Rooster_79> @realDonaldTrump It had a very bad ending...
1056695995126423552 2018-10-28 19:55:32 -0400 <KenMcGinley1> @realDonaldTrump @jaketapper Someone like you who has all 9 traits of Narcissism should not be allowed to hold Public office.
1056695994572664832 2018-10-28 19:55:32 -0400 <MMAisBoring> @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Is there any truth that your brother tortured and murdered dogs?
1056695993541054464 2018-10-28 19:55:31 -0400 <howardmoore611> @exavierpope @evanFmoore The only thing @realDonaldTrump knows about professional sports is how to bankrupt and take down an entire league #USFL

1056695982849736704 2018-10-28 19:55:29 -0400 <lwsfldmn> @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Dearest Sara, one possibility might be that those people were murdered with an A.R. 15, like so many others made possible by the shameless bribes taken by your hero and the rest of his GOProstitutes from The Bank Of NRA. Do what you can to keep him from shooting caravan children.
1056695980643545090 2018-10-28 19:55:28 -0400 <sjaramillo2003> Hey @BobHugin   Saw your commercial...  Know what I won't be able to explain to my children...  Supporting @realDonaldTrump   How vile is he, yet you support him.  Go fuck yourself!  I'm voting for @SenatorMenendez, and I'm bringing friends with me...
