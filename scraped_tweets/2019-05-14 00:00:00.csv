1128449120883101697 2019-05-14 19:56:50 -0400 <Geraldberlin1> @realDonaldTrump So here’s the problem with being a serial liar.  I hope this is true but I cannot take your word for it so I’ll do a little quick research.  If you never lied I would assume it’s true.  But you lie.  A lot.  That’s sad to have to say to the US President.  It’s a shame.

He is enacting tariffs in the interest of America, #maga. As you show various Trump businesses will suffer price increases or have to switch suppliers.
