951966480572203009 2018-01-12 18:57:50 -0400 <usahome> @realDonaldTrump, easily placed on top of the mountain of words that describe you (all negative), is the word: disgusting. You are a disgusting human being.

951966474951938050 2018-01-12 18:57:48 -0400 <evil_blond_goth> @mrstimmypaws @dreamsingreen @anmlnut12 @ZemanLynnZ @realDonaldTrump As for childish well the empty straw man that is you tweet fits right into that category. Cogent and factual counter argument are much better than childish vapid statements. Your tweet is the cyber equivalent of a child sticking it fingers in it ears shouting 'I'm not listening'
951966474868088837 2018-01-12 18:57:48 -0400 <czamarripa72> @realDonaldTrump Not only are you a compulsive liar, but you're a f****** coward as well?! What a poor excuse of a president you are! Why don't you grow a pair, and start owning up to all your pathetic and psychotic mistakes that you have done! You f****** moron!
951966474134056961 2018-01-12 18:57:48 -0400 <DemocratsOnly> @realDonaldTrump The nerve of you to speak on Dr Kings name.
951966474020835328 2018-01-12 18:57:48 -0400 <Gamamabear98> @realDonaldTrump Nope.  You‚Äôre a big, fat baby-hands baby, and THAT‚ÄôS why you didn‚Äôt go.  The queen doesn‚Äôt see you as legitimate, and neither do 63% of Americans.  Good Night!
951966473513205760 2018-01-12 18:57:48 -0400 <djpsom> It is time for a joint statement from @BarackObama @43georgebush @GeorgeHWBush @BillClinton and Jimmy Carter denouncing @realDonaldTrump racist hate statements.
951966471948783617 2018-01-12 18:57:48 -0400 <MotherGoos3> I love our @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #QANON  https://t.co/1s5m3lBpSu

951966468425633792 2018-01-12 18:57:47 -0400 <BakerGene> @politico No, he is not a racist but he is wise and blunt in speaking the truth even though he is a little crude in his manner.  I agree he needs to be more Presidential @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
951966467871858688 2018-01-12 18:57:47 -0400 <utahcon> At what point is @realDonaldTrump going to accept his @Mtn_dew sponsorship. #RealDonaldMountainDewTrump President of the United States of 'Merica!  #IdiocracyIsNow
951966464071946241 2018-01-12 18:57:46 -0400 <Whixergirl> @Franklin_Graham How Christian of @realDonaldTrump to make "shithole" comment about other countries whose populations are mostly POC. How Christian to cheat on his wife with a prostitute. Thoughts and prayers for your complicit soul.
951966463920717824 2018-01-12 18:57:46 -0400 <Jen04> @Umbertobaggio @TVSanjeev @AJemaineClement @realDonaldTrump That would explain Bannon...

951966461525979136 2018-01-12 18:57:45 -0400 <kimmy_is_real> @FoxNews @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Please lock this woman up so we don‚Äôt ever have 2 hear or see her again &amp; her crooked cronies! She called ALL TRUMP SUPPORTERS, WHO ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS, DEPLORABLES! She doesn‚Äôt have the right 2 an opinion. Look what she did 2 the Haitians! OMG! Talk about us being Hypocrites!
951966458942230528 2018-01-12 18:57:45 -0400 <IOBOFFICIAL> I am becoming increasingly concerned at the way people are being condemned as bigots and racists for merely voicing their opinion and saying what the majority are thinking, writes Susan Richardson. #ukip #tory @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @RoyalFamily  https://t.co/f7DZsZsz5G  https://t.co/oMaDSmE6pe
