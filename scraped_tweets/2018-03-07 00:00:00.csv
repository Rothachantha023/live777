971535768798851072 2018-03-07 18:59:12 -0400 <JACochran29> @ColMorrisDavis @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Agree. There are 235 million plus eligible voters. 27% of eligible voters voted for Trump. As for the electoral college. MI, PA, and WI was determined by 77,000 votes. That's not "overwhelming", that is barely.
971535766450003968 2018-03-07 18:59:11 -0400 <kanderson478> @GOP @realDonaldTrump I'm sad to say that the removal of those regulations could very well destroy the environment...the GOP apparently only cares about money and not our children.

971535351637598208 2018-03-07 18:57:32 -0400 <TerraMarQue> Seems the @realDonaldTrump Indictments &amp; Impeachment will be difficult. He is not attached to reality. The @GOP follows him to their political graves. We've never seen Federal Marshals pry a president from the White House. Could be a first.

I would love to see a true conservative run, but I'm not sure if the GOP is capable of allowing them the nod. I'd also be surprised if he is still around by then.

Instead of acting like the world pray for him unless you do not have the H.S.

Europeans (and others) who "condemned" Bush &amp; the neocons/warhawks were proven to be largely correct - the bases for attacking Iraq were almost entirely fabricated.

It would have been shot down by SC! It violates Federal Law. He said on many occasions he wasn't a King! He knew he couldn't do it and that's why he didn't take it to Congress. A President does not have the authority to give citizenship to illegals!
