When someone's personal decisions put other people's lives in danger, that's crossing a line.

No Mexico paying for it-instead using taxpayer $ and some of our military $ for it - wrong to do to try to keep a campaign promise. For 3 years now have said it's easy and the wall is going up so fast-lies!
