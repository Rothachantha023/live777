You lose a credibility preacher man when you support an adulterous thief who mocks children.   Guess the Bible doesn‚Äôt appeal to you.

The POTUS is supposed to represent the highest ideals of America. Instead, Trump is the personification of greed and dishonesty. He is not a major dude. His election was a mistake.
