1095472344338853888 2019-02-12 18:58:54 -0400 <donmccormick> @realDonaldTrump This is face-saving, plain and simple. The Democrats took away your wall funding so now you’re trying to act like it doesn’t matter because you can get it done another way. But Congress controls the purse strings, not you, and Congress is no longer controlled by Republicans.
1095472344338841600 2019-02-12 18:58:54 -0400 <GazzArt84> @ColumbiaBugle @realDonaldTrump They have no idea how Trump won despite their heavy duty programming. Their heads will be spinning when he's re-elected in 2020.

1095472342124290050 2019-02-12 18:58:53 -0400 <SusanRPittman> @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC Direct evidence simply means that the truth of an assertion directly supported. Circumstantial evidence consists of a fact or set of facts which supports an inference that the matter is true. You are toast with circumstantial evidence.

The campaign head offering to give polling data to a Russian oligarch is collusion. You can pretend like all this doesn't add up if you want, but there's too much smoke to ignore.
1095472331483500545 2019-02-12 18:58:51 -0400 <BrewsHoos> @realDonaldTrump I also just received $21 BILLION to prove you exaggerate and lie to save face. Honestly, it’s self-funding.
1095472330862555136 2019-02-12 18:58:51 -0400 <Jaminallnight> @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC They were never interested in Russian collusion in the first place. If they really were then their focus would have almost solely been on the democrats. This rouse was a means of attacking the president, and destroying both him, and his associates for process crimes.

If you want a bigger refund next year what you have to do is increase your weekly withholdings. To get a $5,000 refund you need to have $96 a week or equivalent amount if you are paid monthly or biweekly
