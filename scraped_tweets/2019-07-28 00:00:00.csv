1155628464273317889 2019-07-28 19:57:51 -0400 <maryderrickart> @realDonaldTrump so you've appointed a man who doesn't believe the intel that the intelligence agencies arrive at as their head, I'm sure that will just send their morale soaring !  You are surrounding yourself as all Dictators do with people who WILL AGREE with everything you say...SCARY !
