1115040714860236800 2019-04-07 19:56:37 -0400 <ScarletM1926> @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump I was promised better, finer and more beautiful healthcare than Obamacare and free. Where‚Äôs is it?

And we know this because we live in a sanctuary city...
1115040710154178561 2019-04-07 19:56:36 -0400 <etheldaylily> @realDonaldTrump THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND....THAT NO MATTER WHAT THE DEMS SAY OR DO....THEY ARE NOT BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN A COURT OF LAW??? WHAT'S UP WITH THAT????  https://t.co/k1rnu9xj5j
1115040709889994752 2019-04-07 19:56:36 -0400 <Adrian_Benepe> One wonders what terrible things @realDonaldTrump must know are in his tax returns that he won‚Äôt do what every US President has done. That is taxes are ‚Äúunder audit‚Äù is a weasely, BS excuse. #ReleaseTrumpsTaxes #ReleaseTrumpsTaxesNow
1115040709889884161 2019-04-07 19:56:36 -0400 <S2DABUZZ> @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Are you worried you won't be his running mate the 2nd time around? You've been the silent partner. Never hear too much about Mike Pence. I would be very worried.

1115040706651873281 2019-04-07 19:56:35 -0400 <ilovemyggs> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump It didn‚Äôt exonerate Trump. Is specifically stated the opposite.
1115040705502691329 2019-04-07 19:56:35 -0400 <janesmi44731277> @realDonaldTrump  If we all had to pay an "illegal immigrant tax", like we do for "uninsured motorist" folks may get sick of the cost.  People understand that better than the billion figures.
1115040701052530694 2019-04-07 19:56:34 -0400 <EngagednEnraged> @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Trump Promises:  ‚ÄúMexico will pay for the wall.‚Äù ‚ÄúI will release my taxes.‚Äù
