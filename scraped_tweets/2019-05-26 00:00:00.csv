Mueller found no crime, so Trump hasn’t obstructed. Now that Trump has declassified and told Barr show it all to the country, I guess that somehow is also obstruction? 🤷🏻‍♀️

When a person becomes converted or indoctrinated to a particular philosophy, or mind set, it is hard to break away from that train of thought. Trump is like a savior to those people.

1132797222926503936 2019-05-26 19:54:38 -0400 <nidula_b> @tedlieu @PressSec In addition, the moron @realDonaldTrump first tweeted ‘Bidan’ rather than Biden - so not only is Trump low IQ projecting he’s siding with Otto Warmbiers tortuous killer - wonder how his parents feel.

For this man to disrespect so many people and agree with everything a DICTATOR says and then comes back and tell the American people is WRONG.  And Sarah Sanders is NO exception !
