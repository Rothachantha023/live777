I used to think the market wasn't driven up or down by just one person. But, you've convinced me that everything that's happened in the economy since 11/16 is due to you.

The problem is what you're attempting to attribute to biology, isn't. People can change their opinions in a second's time; simply by accepting a realization. That doesn't take rewiring. It is a shift of perspective, not biology.

Who come up with a conspiracy theory of a "deep state?" If dems secretly control everything thru a deep state, how do Republicans have majorities in the House, Senate, Presidency, Supreme court, &amp; 2/3 of state legislatures?

They are in the minority. But he can't beat the combination of liberal minorities Plus moderate conservative Republicans. He can't get the votes in the House and Senate. That's why they have to make deals and Trump
960663857806094336 2018-02-05 18:58:06 -0400 <nagwood123> @jerome_corsi @realDonaldTrump Tell trump I want all the children that have been abused set free now ! I want my daughter back ! They took her as a sex slave and she was pure !!!
960663857369788417 2018-02-05 18:58:06 -0400 <jordaneous0> @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump He‚Äôs trying to redefine the term treason (and also gin up his base) so that when he‚Äôs finally accused of it by Mueller, the deplorables will still support him.
960663856971317249 2018-02-05 18:58:06 -0400 <dwax> Obviously @BarackObama snuck back into the @WhiteHouse today and pulled down on the lever that @realdonaldtrump uses to make the stock market go so bigly.

The stock market reflecting your policies just plummeted nearly 1200 pts. You're a failure and a big mess. Don't you think this job is over your head? Resign now!!

They still pay less than we do for health care. Dems want medical care for THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE IT. You have no clue.
