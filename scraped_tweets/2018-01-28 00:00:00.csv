957765070355709953 2018-01-28 18:59:21 -0400 <jkskinny35> @realDonaldTrump Yes. Thank you, Obama. Obama entered his presidency with the country in shambles, thanks to Bush and his stupid invasion to conquer and become superior nation. It was at the end of his presidency that the country was put back together, like increasing black employment.

957764286486425600 2018-01-28 18:56:14 -0400 <GeezusChrysler> @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Hilarious! In the same tweet, he complains that the Dems are using nasty politics while using nasty politics. This fake sheriff is silly beyond belief. Someone should take him to the hat store to see if they have them in child sizes.
