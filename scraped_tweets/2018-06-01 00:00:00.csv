This is the acting role of the century - playing PM.  He gets his scripts from Butts.  He has his stylists and makeup artists.  He gets to play dress up.  This feeds his narcissistic psychology. Worst PM in history.  https://t.co/RzjNEDoe1e

1002700270680330240 2018-06-01 19:55:48 -0400 <JW4081> @traciemom @GOP @realDonaldTrump üòÇüòÇüòÇ except have a look around. Its the leftist hysteria news claiming Trump broke some law by having freedom of speech &amp; telling America how good the job report is üòÇüòÇ Everyone w a brain can see its the left who is full of h8 &amp; devision. They are desperate to lie for voters.

1002700259032748032 2018-06-01 19:55:45 -0400 <CountryLiberal> @TonjaSimmons @realDonaldTrump Solar &amp; wind are so reliable that in Houston, TX oil capital, 40% of home plans are 100% solar and wind. I know cause I lived there and had them. 1200 jobs gained vs 9600 lost is Trump math that leads to bankruptcy.  Some business man, that tax cut is balloning the deficit.
1002700258055540737 2018-06-01 19:55:45 -0400 <edel746> It is a dangerous change in politics that @realDonaldTrump uses to pass his unethical agenda.  https://t.co/F7HFvmW7lp
