Even if the crime was committed before the election. Even if it could be Trump, he’d simply pardon himself &amp; the current GOP reps wouldn’t bat an eye. Impeach on day one after 2018 crop is sworn in. The only way.

971897454101712896 2018-03-08 18:56:24 -0400 <GirlGraci> @KathleenKitche @ProudResister @realDonaldTrump Interesting. Probably right, or something like it.
971897452306489344 2018-03-08 18:56:24 -0400 <ShutUpAmanda> @Flipyap1 @realDonaldTrump That’s a question for them, not for me. Whatever makes them support a man like him is an issue for them to examine within themselves.   I can only speak to my standards, which are decidedly higher than that.
971897451543257089 2018-03-08 18:56:24 -0400 <Acme_Catapult> @realDonaldTrump Maybe Melania could try applying for a Visa.

971897451052453889 2018-03-08 18:56:23 -0400 <teetaorelsie> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Dear God, I love this man.  Protect him from all evil- doers. He is our man !
971897450792390656 2018-03-08 18:56:23 -0400 <ukrulz21> @ProudResister @realDonaldTrump Let’s see how fast @realDonaldTrump @POTUS screws this up!
971897448137281537 2018-03-08 18:56:23 -0400 <kh07scott> @realDonaldTrump @ToupsFamily The reason I am asking this is that someone has to pay for the change this is going to effect. Hope it is not our Jobs we have now because of this new tuff law on steel and aluminum.
971897447982206976 2018-03-08 18:56:23 -0400 <shadesofnuni> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump So this is how it’s gonna go down. They are going to lure trump and the clan of criminals over there. Blow them up and instead of being a war there will be a celebration 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

971897445985738752 2018-03-08 18:56:22 -0400 <charlie_quinn21> @realDonaldTrump if you're going to say video games are the issue, then I want you to explain to me why they caused the civil war. Why they caused the whipping and hanging of black people in the 1960s. Why they caused the Vietnam war.
971897445872488448 2018-03-08 18:56:22 -0400 <swon26> @Kasparov63 Still treasonous @realDonaldTrump won't single out his boss thug Putin. Won't sign BIPARTISAN bill to impose more sanctions on gangster Putin. Puppet Trump SCARED of him, because murderer Putin has something BIG on him! Mueller on his way to find out what is it!
971897443829895168 2018-03-08 18:56:22 -0400 <rhetttougeaux> @JACKIEBEAT @StormyDaniels @intouchweekly @realDonaldTrump Pleaaaase let there be dick pics. I, for one, would pay one whole dollar to glimpse that wretched carrot. You know, the way one might be interested in seeing a car on fire, or the ravages of a flesh-eating virus...  And why was Stormy prohibited from disclosing paternity info?

971897425496608768 2018-03-08 18:56:17 -0400 <FriendOfTheYeti> @Bernie_MAN27 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Obama and Bush had enough sense not to go over there and meet with him directly within conditions worked out ahead of time. Since, NK will not disarm, there is no point.
971897423521112064 2018-03-08 18:56:17 -0400 <TheCentryst> @SoCallls @olgaNYC1211 @realDonaldTrump We have to stop him by stopping his enablers the money people who benefit from his decisions. We have to force their hands if they suffer financially he goes.
