Just so we are clear, letting people die because of relaxed regulations, that causes pollution does not make "clean air and clean water."

1070104669870088193 2018-12-04 18:56:49 -0400 <spdavidson71> @realDonaldTrump Two things. First, ‚ÄúI am a Tariff Man‚Äù isn‚Äôt quite as deep as the ‚Äúonly thing we have to fear is fear itself‚Äù, but it is catchy. Second, do you really think that when another country sells goods here in the US, it is ‚Äúraid[ing] the great wealth of our nation‚Äù? Just horribly sad.

Trump isn't smart enough to stop himself from breaking the law,  he will force the House and the Senate to impeach him. I think he's ready personally he just doesn't want any repercussions.
