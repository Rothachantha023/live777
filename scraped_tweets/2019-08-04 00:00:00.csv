1158165047098662913 2019-08-04 19:57:19 -0400 <symplee_amazin> @realDonaldTrump Surprised at a state level there are not charges filed for culpability in these mass shootings. There are reams of evidence pointing to DJT all the way down to the deleting of tweets which shows consciousness of guilt.

Labeling Socialism the destruction it is as seen in our largest cities; and label WHITE SUPREMACY SOCIALISTS, &amp; ANTIFA FASCISTS: "TERRORIST GROUPS."

Not saying gun reform isn‚Äôt possible, but maybe, just maybe could there be more to it?
