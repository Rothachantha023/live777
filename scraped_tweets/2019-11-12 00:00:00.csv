No one is trying to ignore that he asked for both.  The Biden "favor" is more important as it's Trump directly extorting a foreign country to interfere in our upcoming election.

All of the extra growth since 2017 was provided by a fiscal boost from tax cuts &amp; spending increases as Republican lawmakers turned from austerity budgets under Obama to stimulus under Trump.  https://t.co/oubx3YHYRu

Yr continual EPA rollbacks, pro. coal,  https://t.co/BjhV4gdROP Climate Agreement stance proves that. May you be impeached lightning speed. Scaramucci is probably the most accurate. You will be gone by early Spring.  Thank the Lord

1194403709125447680 2019-11-12 18:56:49 -0400 <therealdanelee> @ScottPresler @CreditAnnie That the @realDonaldTrump message is resonating all the way to Hawaii is a very significant development. This shows that America‚Äôs bedrock ideals of free speech, markets, capitalism, limited government and lawful order are powerfully uplifting when followed faithfully. #Trump2020

He also stated that she broke the law, but said she shouldn't be prosecuted.  You didn't know this, you believed that Congress can indict. Your level of ignorance is beyond a mere human's ability to educate. Buh-bye.
