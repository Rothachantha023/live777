1202014278133391361 2019-12-03 18:58:30 -0400 <luvcats13> Supporting @realDonaldTrump means ABSOLUTE loyalty, instead of a Governor doing what he thinks is best for State of Georgia. I applaud Governor @BrianKempGA for standing up to Washington! No idea if Kelly Loeffler is the right choice but I know panderer @RepDougCollins IS NOT!
