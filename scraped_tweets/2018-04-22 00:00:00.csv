988205806712705024 2018-04-22 19:59:58 -0400 <smkaras> First, honest racism isn't commendable. Second, if you get an honest vibe from @realDonaldTrump, you are unquestionably an idiot.
988205802006728704 2018-04-22 19:59:57 -0400 <_ExpressYrself> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Yeah... GOP lawmakers who are not above the law and many of them should be investigated as well... should push for Hillary's investigation particularly. This so she can be cleared and sue (Guess who, Mr. Dennison?) for slanderous libel. She'd win and give proceeds to DNC.
988205793697771520 2018-04-22 19:59:55 -0400 <KarenHo15746106> @realDonaldTrump This has nothing to do with this stupid tweet.
