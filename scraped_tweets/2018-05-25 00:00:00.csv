There is no "equal time" requirement for them to also investigate campaigns that aren't committing crimes.

The optimism comes from a pro business attitude and the support given to the avg person. The elitism of Obama admin. served only those that  thought the few knew more then the ppl. No one has helped the poor, middle class and working ppl until now.
