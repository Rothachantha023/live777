Canadians live longer, are healthier, lower mother and infant mortality and have less lost time on the job due to health concerns.   Almost everyone from any country with nationalized healthcare will never give that up.
1110692094174216193 2019-03-26 19:56:45 -0400 <AnonomouslYours> @ForeverLogical @almlie_rachel @realDonaldTrump The thing is, his supporters have an anger about immigrants because their own "gimme, gimme, gimme" mentality can't stand anyone getting something they don't get, too ... even if they don't need it.  They're the snot-nosed kids who grew up saying "no fair!" all the time.

1110692090252615687 2019-03-26 19:56:44 -0400 <kolsaw> @paulkirk7 @realDonaldTrump What does "collusion" have to do with anything since it means nothing legally? My point was that Trump and his campaign accepted and encouraged Russian interference in US elections, and that is unethical and anti-democratic.
1110692088109322242 2019-03-26 19:56:44 -0400 <Hskers62> @GOP @realDonaldTrump So instead of funding Special Olympics and other programs for needy kids, the Wall is more important? Got it

No motive no crime no opportunity for coercion. Done and done. If you want to believe some crazy conspiracy theory because that's all you have go for it
1110692086754488321 2019-03-26 19:56:43 -0400 <cprinatlanta> @GOP @realDonaldTrump yes, we do Americans cannot afford to see dr and millions don't earn livable wages.

How about babies born with pre-existing conditions?  Should they be denied coverage. Do we only care before they are born?

1110692067871805441 2019-03-26 19:56:39 -0400 <dmzhukova> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS It‚Äôs unconscionable to let a man as sick as Donald Trump continue  in office. Republicans are exploiting his mental instability. They ignore &amp; even applaud his disconnect from reality &amp; they repeat his delusional lies. They‚Äôll use him then scapegoat him.   https://t.co/NlMSqWHme4
