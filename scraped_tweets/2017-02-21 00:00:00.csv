834190457374662656 2017-02-21 18:57:58 -0400 <TheDeadKalm> I'm glad @realDonaldTrump is finding out the definition of protest. Speaking of Sad.
834190457060130822 2017-02-21 18:57:58 -0400 <11Thanlon> @realDonaldTrump the so called president thinks any opposition to him is somehow inauthentic because he's never experienced consequences.
834190455495553024 2017-02-21 18:57:57 -0400 <americanbyforce> @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Thats bs. This is all on the American people.
834190455319429120 2017-02-21 18:57:57 -0400 <hammijo> @realDonaldTrump does that make sense to you?  I can't voice concerns to my republican senator? Do you even know how this government works?
834190455059390466 2017-02-21 18:57:57 -0400 <tmattmann> @DavidPoeRN @realDonaldTrump the crowds of people ARE the liberal activists.
834190454895833088 2017-02-21 18:57:57 -0400 <Kathi6752> FAKE pres @realDonaldTrump  must be FAKE NEWS  because it's not  Fox News.
834190453893382144 2017-02-21 18:57:57 -0400 <kenquandt> @Lwme07 @balthsbart @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Yes. Utterly mystifying.
834190452828098560 2017-02-21 18:57:57 -0400 <nccole_treadway> @realDonaldTrump This is the reason u will fail! U don't reconize a honest up rising when u see it, instead of talking to their concerns.
834190452232294400 2017-02-21 18:57:56 -0400 <wayneswhirld> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Brainwashed by Faux News! #ImpeachTrump #NotMyPresident #TrumpLies #resist

834190449669713920 2017-02-21 18:57:56 -0400 <J_plus_8> Hey @realDonaldTrump @POTUS are these some of those liberal activists you speak of?  https://t.co/o09JqUmXrU

834190446528167936 2017-02-21 18:57:55 -0400 <SJflforhillary> @realDonaldTrump damn. Other people are getting paid for this? Then again, wouldn't take the money if it was offered
834190445508952064 2017-02-21 18:57:55 -0400 <cham_salam> @realDonaldTrump You're alone in thinking @FoxNews suffices an intelligence briefing. Sad!
834190444884066306 2017-02-21 18:57:55 -0400 <BrigittePeck> @realdonaldtrump Real people are affected by the company you keep  https://t.co/76i7RvwBHB
834190443323781120 2017-02-21 18:57:54 -0400 <paintinghorses> @TheBuss878 @politico @BiancaJoanie  @realDonaldTrump lied to you. She hasn't committed a crime, @POTUS knows it - he just wanted ur vote
834190442564636673 2017-02-21 18:57:54 -0400 <JohnYuma> @realDonaldTrump Get off the golf course and listen to the American people, Drumpf.

834190442145136640 2017-02-21 18:57:54 -0400 <georgiacaver> @realDonaldTrump right. Planning = insincerity? No. Ask the tea partiers who paved the way for you. SAD!
834190440526180357 2017-02-21 18:57:54 -0400 <iubsudad> @realDonaldTrump  These are angry crowds,  paid or unpaid. They are expressing their God given right to protest. A very wrong issue!!
834190440123428865 2017-02-21 18:57:54 -0400 <TonyMat1> @realDonaldTrump see, those "republicans" represent ALL the people in their districts. Liberals vote too, and they can be fired.
834190439326576640 2017-02-21 18:57:53 -0400 <NaturesGma> @realDonaldTrump I can guarantee that I am NOT a paid political activist!! DO YOUR JOB!!
834190438999392257 2017-02-21 18:57:53 -0400 <jeaniedoogan> if you routinely buy ur kids Big Gulps from 7-11 or take them to @Hooters, you're a shitty parent. &amp; I assume u voted for @realDonaldTrump
834190434700140544 2017-02-21 18:57:52 -0400 <jonfavs> Hey @realDonaldTrump - look at all those so-called liberal activists in the elitist bastion of West Fork, Arkansas  https://t.co/K590lxlOOl

834190432418537477 2017-02-21 18:57:52 -0400 <PatrickJehle1> @UweBollocks @realDonaldTrump love too be governed by I Ching and dice from an old backgammon set

834190432263340036 2017-02-21 18:57:52 -0400 <marcosidahmed> @realDonaldTrump you are delusional
834190432103964672 2017-02-21 18:57:52 -0400 <JacquiVotesBlue> @realDonaldTrump no, they don't.. maybe Republican's that pretend to be "Christians" like you and your 3rd wife, had to READ Lord's prayer!

834190426722689024 2017-02-21 18:57:50 -0400 <KyanaBelle> @realDonaldTrump When ordinary ppl feel their country is facing genuine threat, they tend to voice their opposition in groups to be heard
834190425133039616 2017-02-21 18:57:50 -0400 <ebradcliffe> Wow. Unbelievable @POTUS @realDonaldTrump  @PressSec  https://t.co/pTbsuCBItZ
834190424797360128 2017-02-21 18:57:50 -0400 <SAGordon64> @JenZny @RogueCPI @realDonaldTrump Of constituents no less. He forgets that the elected officials serve ALL in their districts.
