That was a really dumb move on their part, but to make this all about Trump and how great he is, is even dumber. Trump has broken the law ... hence settlements. I see you've modeled yourself after name-caller-in chief.

932397913971548160 2017-11-19 18:59:20 -0400 <JarrettBellini> @realDonaldTrump Did ... we ... just ... agree ... on ... something?

932397913770209280 2017-11-19 18:59:20 -0400 <BigIke1313> @realDonaldTrump Mr President there is no need to respond.
932397913443053569 2017-11-19 18:59:20 -0400 <AzzarNTmurt> @FoxNews @dsjohnson1957 @realDonaldTrump We're talking about thieves. They committed a crime. Trump has ZERO obligation to get them released. The least he is owed is called GRATITUDE.
932397913027649536 2017-11-19 18:59:20 -0400 <WallaceRitchie> @realDonaldTrump "horror show"  https://t.co/mclVd69EvR

932397912155234306 2017-11-19 18:59:20 -0400 <pupshaw1479> @realDonaldTrump Another distraction.
932397911371075585 2017-11-19 18:59:19 -0400 <LuckyBedford> @realDonaldTrump You are sick. Bad enough us humans have to deal with you. Leave animals alone.
932397910649688064 2017-11-19 18:59:19 -0400 <cinny_bot> @realDonaldTrump Nobody is surprised of these tweets...you can't get something for nothing w you!
932397910301528064 2017-11-19 18:59:19 -0400 <barryonash> @realDonaldTrump I accidentally overdosed on marijuana and am trying to get my life back together. A retweet would go a long way to help.

932397909294841857 2017-11-19 18:59:19 -0400 <JillRyanNikita> @Helovedmefirst @greta @realDonaldTrump I'm sorry, with my education I do have a job.  But the industry outsources to foreign countries while many in the IT world are laid off.  I am on the safe freaking planet.
932397909051658240 2017-11-19 18:59:19 -0400 <nyma11> @realDonaldTrump agreed, you should see the penalty in China for sexual assault there.
932397908107898886 2017-11-19 18:59:19 -0400 <PatriotsWay_> @SecretService @realDonaldTrump Another one with threats to @POTUS life! #Trump #DeathThreat  https://t.co/Irp4GYrb9W
932397907902377986 2017-11-19 18:59:19 -0400 <nuckingfutz33> @realDonaldTrump Wow so allow the trophies, why would you do the right thing, you haven't done anything right yet! We expect the worse from you and we are never disappointed
932397906853875713 2017-11-19 18:59:18 -0400 <treybritt42> @realDonaldTrump Man, you got trolled hard by @Lavarbigballer and now you can't keep his name out your mouth.  Gold.
932397906228805633 2017-11-19 18:59:18 -0400 <4SClaire> @peplamb @realDonaldTrump Bot!
932397905842966529 2017-11-19 18:59:18 -0400 <LindaAnneCrawf1> @KellyHend39 @Shastina_Eloff @realDonaldTrump Yes, but it is beautiful, especially in the fall. Low tech living wage jobs are needed there. Like my state, also a poor state, the same type of jobs are needed. Out petrochemical jobs are dangerous and we have a very high cancer and lung disease rate.
932397905280929792 2017-11-19 18:59:18 -0400 <PA_MAGA_Militia> @realDonaldTrump Amazing how Mr. Trump had to tell them to say thanks.  They were not going to say thanks because they are ungrateful idiots.
932397905138331648 2017-11-19 18:59:18 -0400 <EleanorRigbyATX> @realDonaldTrump News Flash!!! @jeffflake is one of our favorite people. He stepped up &amp; decided not to lie to his constituents &amp; other Americans &amp; not to allow you to continue to deceive the American people.  He is voting in a manner that works for Americans, not the 1%.  https://t.co/tqkN5xoY8b
932397904467300353 2017-11-19 18:59:18 -0400 <HardSkin666> @realDonaldTrump Wat?
932397903112523778 2017-11-19 18:59:17 -0400 <seaquai> @realDonaldTrump So you believe some polls?
932397902844104704 2017-11-19 18:59:17 -0400 <LeavittLee> @realDonaldTrump Release your tax returns so America knows how devious and corrupt you are!  You LIED saying this fake ‚Äúreform‚Äù would cost you.  We are not stupid. #RESIGN
932397902789595137 2017-11-19 18:59:17 -0400 <Average_Skeptic> @realDonaldTrump This is not a drama series
932397902642733059 2017-11-19 18:59:17 -0400 <annie_oakley2> @ProducerKen @realDonaldTrump He shows some character. Can u imagine how hurtful this whole thing has been to him. His dad must üêù a super ass.

932397902416117760 2017-11-19 18:59:17 -0400 <zelduh> @ezlusztig @realDonaldTrump Elliott, I usually respect your opinion.  But, on this particular issue, I most sincerely disagree.  Quite simply, Trump cannot stop being a dick. It is his abject lack of empathy and insight that makes him a dick. He was born without these basic qualities. They cannot be learned
932397902059540480 2017-11-19 18:59:17 -0400 <BladerLab> @realDonaldTrump If you think that shoplifting = 5-10 years, how many years does perjury, which is a very big deal in the USA get?   Your son in law may be interested in knowing your thoughts about this.
932397902005227527 2017-11-19 18:59:17 -0400 <ZackMS> @realDonaldTrump Man, you can‚Äôt let a good action away unsullied, huh?
932397901833232384 2017-11-19 18:59:17 -0400 <Peggyw66> @realDonaldTrump Hooray for Mr. Flake!!
932397901703196675 2017-11-19 18:59:17 -0400 <Basiljjp1291> @realDonaldTrump Please explain. Are you saying that hunting animals for sport helps conservation?
932397901568933889 2017-11-19 18:59:17 -0400 <caragal_> @realDonaldTrump, ‚ÄúFavorite American President?‚Äù All u want is to be praised like the dictators u hang out with. These 3 people owe u nothing. You did it for your own ego.  Why not help Puerto Rico, or do something humane? üá∫üá∏, sick of the abuse yet?  https://t.co/3bICpQWFqw
932397901095014400 2017-11-19 18:59:17 -0400 <JonyIveParody> @realDonaldTrump I hope you give the elephant a rose. üçäü§°

932397899211792387 2017-11-19 18:59:16 -0400 <MitchD71896900> @realDonaldTrump Yiu are out of your orange mind. You started this topic, now drop it. Protect the elephants.
932397898532311040 2017-11-19 18:59:16 -0400 <Meta4ikl> @realDonaldTrump Why not declare all animals open season
