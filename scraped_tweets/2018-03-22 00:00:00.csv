976971554050330624 2018-03-22 19:59:04 -0400 <jr_important> @realDonaldTrump John Bolton was part of the effort to mislead the US into the disastrous Iraq war and has supported military action against North Korea and Iran. He was too extreme to be confirmed as UN ambassador in 2005 and is absolutely the wrong person to be national security advisor now.
