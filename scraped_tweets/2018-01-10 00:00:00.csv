Not a virtual or even a natural barrier, the illegals will only laugh at it if it’s open anywhere that’s where they will go

951241672385589249 2018-01-10 18:57:42 -0400 <FillipQuinn> @realDonaldTrump Right.  But it had nothing to do with it, but OK.
951241671890513922 2018-01-10 18:57:42 -0400 <AgustinoReggie> @realDonaldTrump Chillax. Why are you sweating this investigation? If you are innocent, then you don’t have to worry about this investigation.

951241671538331650 2018-01-10 18:57:42 -0400 <TrueBlue2018> Disgusting fuck.  Wouldn’t surprise me at all.   It would take more than just getting peed on to generate this level of conspiracy with Russia.   Putin has our leader by the balls....... @realDonaldTrump you’re going to prison asshole.  #ImpeachTrump #TrumpIsSexualPredator  https://t.co/Amsbm7ZQMb

951241667809501186 2018-01-10 18:57:41 -0400 <stewartdperry> @edstetzer @realDonaldTrump The lack of compassion (and understanding of what has happened) in many of the comments is astounding. You find more compassion and fidelity to the truth from non- Christians. #shame

Stop trying to imitate Hitler and start leading this country. You're a fascist. Look it up in the dictionary. I doubt you know what it means.
951241661492940805 2018-01-10 18:57:39 -0400 <GaryJinTX> @TalbertSwan @HopeRadio1 @realDonaldTrump Dr. King, please. He plagiarized near 50% of his doctoral thesis. Columbia proved this in 1991. He was no doctor.

All presidents sign executive orders, courts can over rule them, as the 9th circuit has done time after time on the idiot in office now and the next president can rescind them
