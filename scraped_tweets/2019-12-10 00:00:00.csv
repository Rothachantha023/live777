1204550870739890182 2019-12-10 18:58:01 -0400 <jpdel11> @RedtailVision @CJ_isnowblue @realDonaldTrump  Nixon didn‚Äôt get impeached, got that Pardon and went home to live out his life in private.  Look like he‚Äôs relieved knowing he‚Äôs not going to Prison. Tell Nancy to slow this impeachment down to think about it. Otherwise tough love coming your way.
1204550869917659137 2019-12-10 18:58:01 -0400 <NavyCaptRet63XX> @thedoggeneral1 @realDonaldTrump I can see not all the money or anyone was smart enough to advise him on correctly wearing that military uniform and medals then. Sad and pathetic I‚Äôm just saying.
1204550869791830016 2019-12-10 18:58:01 -0400 <Faymow> @realDonaldTrump How many more kids have to be shot during your term as POTUS before you do more than give them thoughts and prayers?  How about taking guns away from criminals before they shoot more kids. Maybe that will kids feel safer.
1204550868575625216 2019-12-10 18:58:01 -0400 <Write_Sense> @Jim_Jordan Regretfully, you have not made a case to "defend" @realDonaldTrump conduct &amp; behavior. You can't so you focus on the process. Deep in the dark corners of the Capitol - you all whisper what an IMBECILE #Trump is. You all KNOW. You know his character, his practices &amp; yet you stay.
1204550868126912512 2019-12-10 18:58:01 -0400 <kgirl4650> @realDonaldTrump Nothing wrong my ASS!! You were wrong the day you took office. If your so good give the Dems what they ask for.

1204550865182511110 2019-12-10 18:58:00 -0400 <NazarethII> @octomore1 @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Seriously?  Bernie and the rest of the Dem candidates are openly going socialist and you accuse Trump of being a commie?  Huh ahaha
1204550865148878850 2019-12-10 18:58:00 -0400 <cccharley2> @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Like he didn‚Äôt have the tv on and didn‚Äôt see it live. He was peeved the conversation wasn‚Äôt about him

1204550864175656960 2019-12-10 18:58:00 -0400 <1VoodooKitty1> @realDonaldTrump I bet you do feel better after this meeting... it helps to have clear directives from your boss before addressing serious issues impacting our country.

1204550861227253769 2019-12-10 18:57:59 -0400 <potus_turd> @realDonaldTrump Schiff is just about as corrupt as it gets. Trust me, I know corrupt when I see it, like looking in a mirror, totally corrupt, the corruptest person in history. Schiff I mean, not me.
1204550861130735616 2019-12-10 18:57:59 -0400 <Gerald_Weaver_> @realDonaldTrump @KMGGaryde 1) Some dweeb White House press person wrote a release that said Trump told Lavrov/Russia not to meddle in our election.  2) Lavrov denies this.  3) Trump merely says they "Discussed" "Election Meddling."  This means Trump "Discussed" getting them to help him get elected, again.  https://t.co/uFstHhd2dZ
