1018284002044727296 2018-07-14 19:59:59 -0400 <chrispaulmhd> @BBCPolitics @realDonaldTrump Reagan won Wisconsin twice dude.

He thinks WAY too much of himself, but hey look at Jimbob Comey.

I do know he wanted to keep firing FBI until someone would fire Mueller so the invest. would end. Even Sessions didn't want to involve himself. Mueller's still there. He's looking into the Flynn-Russia connection. However, trump's not the target.
