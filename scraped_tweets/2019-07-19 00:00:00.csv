A racist is killing kids in cages because he needs his brand of facism to have an enemy. If he can have idiots believe his lies he gets to hurt those he finds offensive.

Not having lived through that, but having studied it, to my mind that makes so much sense. It seems, from what I know of that period, to sadly match up.
