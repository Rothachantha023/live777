There's a 100% chance this story is not accurate.

1170486327898497024 2019-09-07 19:57:41 -0400 <Cmalet50> @realDonaldTrump So let me get this straight, you were going to invite the Taliban to the US only DAYS before the 18th anniversary of 9/11?  Just when I think you can‚Äôt get any lower......
1170486326686289921 2019-09-07 19:57:41 -0400 <JUSTONEPOST2> @april_HandH @linxiaolan @Hisbride3 @MemphisJDJ @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump One of the dumbest arguments ever made by a citizen. You live in a country and pay taxes. You may not agree with where or how the taxes are spent (wars, infrastructure, basic government operations and expenses, welfare, whatever you may love or hate). That's how society works.

You don't keep someone in your mind for this long, especially one who is no longer in the public eye, without having a real, genuine thing for them. You got it bad, bud.
