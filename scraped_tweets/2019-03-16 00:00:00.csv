1107068377070108672 2019-03-16 19:57:24 -0400 <JonathanSerret> @realDonaldTrump John McCain may never have been @POTUS  But he was an American Hero and was, by far, more respected and Presidential than you can ever hope to be!  Taking shots at him, after his death, is below the dignity of your office and you should be ashamed.
