He won nearly 20 million votes, but 0 electoral votes.

1095834196726214658 2019-02-13 18:56:46 -0400 <FedUpCitzenKrew> @MSNBC Dear @realDonaldTrump- Over the last few years an investigation has been relentlessly bearing down on you. As its gotten heavier you've publicly boasted while privately pacing counting the days to your demise. Let today be a signal that it is near &amp; the future that awaits you!

They are already paying, in holding illegals and housing and feeding them, saving us millions. They are payin in tariffs and they will be paying more yet.  One way or another they'll pay for it.

If true, Whitaker must be brought up on charges!
