I’m not sure what you mean. I’m just trying to point out that someone could misunderstand the intent, and that’s probably what they’re upset about. It’s not wrong to re-read something you wrote and say, “Oh now I see how you might get there.”

Have you been to california? Have you stepped foot in our national forests or tried to hike our ravines?? I know Trump probably has never been on a voluntary hike in his life.
