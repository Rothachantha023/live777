1086412585220489216 2019-01-18 18:58:39 -0400 <Rick_MacKay> Border Patrol estimates there is 1,900 miles of border. A 20' high double-brick wall will require 2,774,000,000 bricks. That's TRILLION. Every US resident, including children and infants, would have to provide 8.5 bricks. Facts.   And BTW, FU @realDonaldTrump  @DonaldJTrumpJr

1086412577163411458 2019-01-18 18:58:37 -0400 <DebraSSchneider> @frfrankpavone @realDonaldTrump Newsflash. There are no dangerous caravans. He makes them up to distract you. Notice when they become an issue? These are refugees seeking asylum in our country as your grandparents most likely did. These are people trying to save their children. America was great until Trump.

He keeps saying if we have this wall we will be stopping majority of drugs, criminals, etc. Only 8% of a wall doesn’t sound enough to keep the gov. shut down. He’s only doing this to save face to his base.
