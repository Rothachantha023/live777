The UK exports steel products to the US fairly - and you have slapped a tariff on these for no other reason than a protectionist whim. This is not a good path to be starting down, tit-for-tat trade wars are bad for all.

A trade war will increase prices on staples as well as housing. The economy will tank. You may start a short term reversal in the trade deficit but kill the US

We're part of the FVEY with you but when our pri minister was called "the opposite of trump" her reaction was to thank the person who said it for the compliment.  You are definitely losing your allies because of his incompetence.

And of course he reversed bad decisions Obama made. Do you even understand what you are talking about? You make to blanket statements about your opinion. Opinion is not fact.

Protectionist policies NEVER WORK. G-d, America was "great again" the last time it gave up its protectionist foreign policy and ushered in a huge age of growth. Poli.Sci. 101.

1003062627545862144 2018-06-02 19:55:41 -0400 <pjpaton> This is evidently psychological warfare from Islamic Jihad + Hamas ( ably backed by their Iranian interlocutors) to deprive the Israeli populace of their sleep + keep them on tender hooks.

As the corporations get tax cuts, the working Americans get to pay more for everything.  The revenue that is going to be pouring in will come at a cost of average hard working Americans.
