1078440007449436164 2018-12-27 18:58:28 -0400 <DarioDiBattista> @realDonaldTrump I mean, since the Uniformed Code of Military Justice means nothing to you, apparently, this is much better than when you encouraged war crimes like shooting rock throwers or suggesting our country shouldn‚Äôt punish a service person who murdered a prisoner.

1078440004471476224 2018-12-27 18:58:28 -0400 <mgmiller300> @realDonaldTrump His ideas were different than yours and not racist. The republicans blocked him, you get blocked by the Dems.  Repubs obstructed for 6 years, you can't expect Dems to play nice for an incompetent liar like you.
