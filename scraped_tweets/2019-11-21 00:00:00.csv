Too many years of corruption shows us it's time the Republican Party be retired to stop that corruption.
1197665885298839552 2019-11-21 18:59:33 -0400 <JardinAngels> Since Criminal-in-Chief @realDonaldTrump’s #UkraineBribery blew up in his face, he has resorted to getting his ventriloquist dummy @LindseyGrahamSC, better known as #LeningradLindsey, to do his dirty work for him to try to smear Biden, the political opponent he’s so terrified of.

1197665695691165697 2019-11-21 18:58:48 -0400 <LonnieJameslee> Everything, Everything #Trump has accused others of, it was he committing the crimes. A con artist distracts, hide, blame, play the victim and disrupts the media or anything that can tell the truth. The #FakeNews is @realDonaldTrump Twitter Feed and the spineless @GOP #FoxNews .

A real leader stays read up and provide leadership to more than an array of criminal (his Administration). At least Rev Al, I'll make the assumption is paying it off. Trump would file bankruptcy /cheat honest ppl (like his phoney charity for Vets)
