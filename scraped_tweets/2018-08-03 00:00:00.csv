1025531091464212481 2018-08-03 19:57:20 -0400 <mzielin1> @realDonaldTrump Exaggerating again. Mfg jobs in the US increased by 37,000 in July,have now increased by 400,000 since you became president per BLS.  Despite the recent gains, the current level of 12,751,000 is 6,802,000‚Äîor 34.8 percent‚Äîbelow peak high of 19,553,000 June of 1979. Long way to go.
