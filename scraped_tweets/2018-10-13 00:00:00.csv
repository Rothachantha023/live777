1051260107370115072 2018-10-13 19:55:15 -0400 <BraveLad> In Ancient Israel's Mosaic Code there were no prisons, rather restitution, restitution + 20%, restitution x 2, x 3, x 7 or even x 10 which was used for the benefit of the aggrieved, not of the State. That's what I advocate. #MAGA #tcot #ccot @realDonaldTrump #teaparty #TrumpTrain

1051260091507400704 2018-10-13 19:55:11 -0400 <DavidFrenkel47> @realDonaldTrump Supporting cheating is what you do since you cheat in so many ways yourself. Redistricting was decided necessary by the SC of Pa. Because the GOP in Pa cheated. Cheating and lying is your special brand and you have made it the GOP brand promise. The majority are wised up now.

1051260084418998272 2018-10-13 19:55:10 -0400 <Dismine> @KpAmericaGreat @realDonaldTrump Thoughts and prayers did it. Too bad they didn‚Äôt help Puerto Rico, that small inaccessible island in the middle of a big ocean.

Basically, people who feel they don't have any control of their own lives resort to trying to control the one thing that they have control over - their bodies. I know, I had horribly abusive parents, and was anorexic from the age of 14 until age 17.

1051260070158315520 2018-10-13 19:55:06 -0400 <Webhead62> @realDonaldTrump How about staying at home and doing some actual work, Adolph Tweetler? Puerto Rico still needs help. Flint still needs water. There are still kids separated from their families. And letting Kanye go on a demented rant in your office doesn‚Äôt count as work.

1051260039372058624 2018-10-13 19:54:59 -0400 <DeborahMM123> "The law regarding depreciation assumes that real estate values decline annually, although often property values actually increase." New York Times: Kushner likely paid almost no income taxes. Legal or not this is another example of the @realDonaldTrump swamp.
