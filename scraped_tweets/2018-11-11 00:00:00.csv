You could have easily held an umbrella to stay dry.  You’re the one who is fake news as you can’t even support this day in public.  Grow Up!!!

Even if Mueller was fired, wouldn't anyone have a backup hard drive or copies of all the evidence to prove crimes? U don't have to be an investigator assigned to investigate a crime to report a crime right?! If u hold the proof?

You will blame anything, even an inanimate object, rather than take the blame or have the buck stop with him. Trump you’re a lowly piece of 💩. Trump is trash, pure garbage.

Trump says EVERYONE involved in the corruption gets prosecuted to the FULLEST extent of the law.  If they were riding "shotgun" for a truck load of fraudulent ballots, their ass is grass, as they say in the law enforcement game.

His complete failure as president and his multiple criminal offenses involving his campaign and his administration should be enough to justify his impeachment and arrest.

Let’s trash the hope of some more of the 22 Republican Senators up in ‘20.  You’re destroying the Republican Party for us, all we have to do is stay the course. Give voters choice.
