Period.  This was done out of retaliation though.  Trump is a big, old, ignorant child.

There is no logic in a legislative process that denies consideration of bills passed in the House. The reason for our bicameral system is to give states an equal voice, not to shutdown Congress.

What will be done about Donald Trump exposing US security measures to our adversaries?  Add it to the long list of things Trump has gotten away with.
1086050084373045253 2019-01-17 18:58:12 -0400 <herownbeat> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @housegop @dscc @HouseDemocrats Don‚Äôt forget that you were voted into office to represent us. This #shutdown is no longer about a wall. It‚Äôs about people‚Äôs egos. All who are furloughed and all who lost services will remember this in 2020.

1086050076823187457 2019-01-17 18:58:10 -0400 <jannykmak> @w_terrence @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump SWEET...isn't it? We finally have a POTUS who will fight back. No more sitting around and taking the sugar honey ice tea being thrown at ANY REPUBLICAN POTUS.  #GOAT
1086050076810723329 2019-01-17 18:58:10 -0400 <YozTheElder> @realDonaldTrump They're closing in on you and you will without doubt be remembered as the most shameful of all U.S. presidents, if remembered at all.

1086050070208761857 2019-01-17 18:58:09 -0400 <SterlingMomo> @realDonaldTrump You and your senior officials are getting paid while Secret Service agents are guarding you without pay.

Pelosi was definitely still seated when Trump had a temper tantrum went &amp; bye-bye like a toddler. No, compromise doesn't mean do exactly as Trump asks.
1086050068162113536 2019-01-17 18:58:08 -0400 <CMR_Gen> @DJMikeSilva @nypost @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov Or say walls are immoral and lives behind one with armed guards. She is the ONLY one of the @HouseDemocrats who is JUST saying absolutely No Wall, even if @realDonaldTrump says he will ReOpen Govt. Why should he open it if she's 100% inflexible?
