945805599073189888 2017-12-26 18:56:41 -0400 <a_tamanna> @POTUS story of one of the trucker. Pulled up to Amazon in WA &amp; they were so excited to see this load deliver I almost laughed. Only 2 days late due to E-logs keep up the good work fellow members. @realDonaldTrump @VP @SenWarren @SenSanders #ELDorME

Hitler was Germany first with a deep-seated hatred of the League of Nations, Trump is America first with hatred of the U.N.. Hitler reneged on an international treaty, so did Trump.
