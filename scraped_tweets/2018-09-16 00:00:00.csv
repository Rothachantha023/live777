Did someone tell him she took a lie detector test?  Or do lie detectors just count if it's in favor of lying liars or #Resistance truth tellers in the WH?

The huge tax cut for the rich didn’t help. Trump announced $200 Billion more in tariffs yesterday.  Prices will rise for everyone. Health care costs rising. Trump has no plan.
