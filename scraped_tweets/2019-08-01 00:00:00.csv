Most people liked him and still do. That is why he could deport so many and not have the political consequences. That is something that you will never have.

It seems having our DC reps work remotely would save money for both them and the taxpayers - no need for dual residences, offices, less travel expenses, plus keep them connected to their constituents.
1157077905949765634 2019-08-01 19:57:24 -0400 <NGDGUP> @realDonaldTrump, a man who falsely claimed he was "president for all Americans" could very easily stop the chanting.

He and the @housegop and @SenateGOP have abdicated their Constitutional duties to represent all of their constituents, not just their party members. Over 50% of the country has no representation. Guess we should stop paying taxes.

He also doesn’t have a clue about accepting previously delegated decision responsibilities.  This is very disruptive to the chain of command.
