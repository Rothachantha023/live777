1035315858573119488 2018-08-30 19:58:30 -0400 <Ronmoreno100> @realDonaldTrump John McCain a true American Hero!
1035315855599591424 2018-08-30 19:58:29 -0400 <counselorfoster> If @realDonaldTrump can't find money in the budget for a nominal #COLA for civil servants, there is certainly no money in the budget for him to go golfing. He and his family should be barred from wasting #taxpayer money on leisure activities until federal workers are paid. @POTUS

1035315853250777088 2018-08-30 19:58:29 -0400 <SusanPaRN321> @realDonaldTrump Really? Because stocks dropped today over more tariffs against Chinese goods. Less than 1/2 of Americans own any stocks including in retirement funds. You also just cut out any pay increases in 2019 for 2 million federal employees including cuts to their retirement.
1035315853137522689 2018-08-30 19:58:29 -0400 <DavidK1964> @realDonaldTrump John McCain will always be remembered as a true patriot and hero. You‚Äôll be remembered as the most corrupt person to ever be POTUS.

He was in fact a Traitor to this Country and I refuse to play along with everyone else who's claiming  that he was a great man, HE WAS NOT he wanted to Destroy America. PRESIDENT TRUMP YOU ARE A GREAT MAN.

Is this decision because you failed to break the federal employee union? Or you forgot who does the real work? How about your cabinet - they get raises?
