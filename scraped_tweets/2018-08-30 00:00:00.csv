The DOJ will not comment to CNN about this as far as I read. I have a sneaky suspicion something is brewing. If state AG and DOJ have the evidence they need the networks will succumb.

1035315858573119488 2018-08-30 19:58:30 -0400 <Ronmoreno100> @realDonaldTrump John McCain a true American Hero!
1035315855599591424 2018-08-30 19:58:29 -0400 <counselorfoster> If @realDonaldTrump can't find money in the budget for a nominal #COLA for civil servants, there is certainly no money in the budget for him to go golfing. He and his family should be barred from wasting #taxpayer money on leisure activities until federal workers are paid. @POTUS

1035315853250777088 2018-08-30 19:58:29 -0400 <SusanPaRN321> @realDonaldTrump Really? Because stocks dropped today over more tariffs against Chinese goods. Less than 1/2 of Americans own any stocks including in retirement funds. You also just cut out any pay increases in 2019 for 2 million federal employees including cuts to their retirement.
1035315853137522689 2018-08-30 19:58:29 -0400 <DavidK1964> @realDonaldTrump John McCain will always be remembered as a true patriot and hero. You’ll be remembered as the most corrupt person to ever be POTUS.
1035315851786956800 2018-08-30 19:58:28 -0400 <tucker16385717> @realDonaldTrump Glad you didn't make it to the McCain Ceremony. He was in fact a Traitor to this Country and I refuse to play along with everyone else who's claiming  that he was a great man, HE WAS NOT he wanted to Destroy America.

Is this decision because you failed to break the federal employee union? Or you forgot who does the real work? How about your cabinet - they get raises?
