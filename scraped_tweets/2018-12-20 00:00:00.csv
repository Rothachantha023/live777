Could it be Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, one of your blonde bimbos or one of the undocumented immigrants that work for you.  By the way, I’m sure if the Trump Shutdown takes place, the Secret Service will love working without pay.

You Mr Trump are ruining the country both internally and externally. You need to go. Congress, get a backbone and if your job. You have all the evidence you need. Invoke the 25th Amendment now.

THEY represent our voices. We did not elect Putin, Fox News, R. Limbaugh, T. Carlson, A. Jones, etc. The President's mandate is to consult with our elected leaders.

1075903493477519361 2018-12-20 18:59:16 -0400 <808WriterGirl> @realDonaldTrump Mattis said the country is headed in the wrong direction. And then he then quit! He cannot stand where you are taking our nation. Be ashamed, be very ashamed.

1075903488310206465 2018-12-20 18:59:15 -0400 <FlaginTatters> My view on Sec. Mattis’ resignation letter. He used too many big words for @realDonaldTrump to understand he’s been accused of being an imbecile on defense of our republic. Here’s hoping someone @WhiteHouse has a dictionary handy. #Kakistocracy #Idiocracy
1075903488050249728 2018-12-20 18:59:15 -0400 <MzMerica> @realDonaldTrump He's not retiring, he resigned. If you could read without the help of #adderall you would know this. #Clusterfuck45 taking america down with him. Worst stockmarket results since 1931 don...how's it feel to be winning at losing?
1075903487681155073 2018-12-20 18:59:15 -0400 <MRSullivan96> Fuck em, bring the troops home no matter who disagrees @realDonaldTrump. What the fuck happened to not being the police of the world? We don't need to be there anymore, and I think it is the right move. This only made me want to vote for Trump more.

I'm embarrassed of the way in-which the Democrats are framing you.  Now we all know that  Democrats and the Devil are the same. Remember that Jesus was hated also when he was alive on earth. Please pray for help

So, like, what's left for the Russians, etc. to fight? Also, the US already has the most powerful military in the world, and has since the late 40s. You know, since around the time you were born.

Devised another policy designed to demonstrate lack of humane treatment of immigrants.  3. Bailed out agricultural business imperiled by ill-advised tariffs and other policy errors 4. Drove out only credible member of staff
