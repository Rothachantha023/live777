Going forward, politicians will have a specific agenda for Blacks just like other minorities or no vote. You can thank 44. Not about 45 but he needs an agenda too.

Well let's face it, he has plenty of experience in that regard! It was absurd to think he could just announce something like that &amp; Denmark would just bow to Trump's statement!
