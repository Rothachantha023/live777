It was $400 billion when he left.  He brought the deficit down. We were in a historic recession when he got the WH.  We were in pretty good shape when he left.  Numbers do matter.

We had a tax cut, and the left says that money is lost. Is it offset by the higher wages and increase in workers? I'm math challenged, but would like some numbers.
