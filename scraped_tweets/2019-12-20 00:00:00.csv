Dems tended to decide no- at least not provably.
1208175024890417152 2019-12-20 18:59:07 -0400 <SHADUCK007> @jasonstaples @realDonaldTrump Recognized "American Christianity" is far from its MiddleEastern roots.

1208174837467951106 2019-12-20 18:58:22 -0400 <AlanTyljas> @realDonaldTrump YOU decided not to send your attorneys. YOU decided not to hand over requested information to the House. YOU are blocking the key witnesses from testifying. And YOU are the person who refuses to testify under Oath like all of the State Department heroes. #IMPOTUS
