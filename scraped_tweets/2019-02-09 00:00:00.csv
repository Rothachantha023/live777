What about America’s desire for democracy in Korea? Please speak complete truth. No other US President has ever done this excepting @POTUS Undeserved praise of Dictetor is bad

1094385245842038785 2019-02-09 18:59:09 -0400 <JohnDRobinson> @literacyisgood @realDonaldTrump I agree that he's abandoned his talking points because they weren't getting over. Democrats need to budge in their wording because they've been clear that there will be no wall but 5 billion for border security and border patrol agents, that could be seen as reasonable.

1094384977469267969 2019-02-09 18:58:05 -0400 <i_focusi> @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Uh, ever heard of Climategate? Most scientists are beholden to those who pay their bills. Climate "science" is the most inaccurate and corrupt of all. Historically almost never right and ALWAYS fear mongering. How much of An Inconvenient Truth was accurate again???

1094384975695302656 2019-02-09 18:58:05 -0400 <enufs_enuf> @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump President Trump is not a racist. Please provide even one FACTUAL example.  He calls her Pocahontas because she has knowingly and blatantly lied for years about her heritage.  He had NEVER mentioned ANY Native American battles, nor asked any Republicans to ridicule them.  Liar.

If 98% of scientists worldwide are in concenses about the issue...what references did you accuire to debate it? Do you own any degree in science?

The media, political parties, racism, classism, etc aren’t here to provide unity. It sucks and I hate it. But cognitive dissonance is the true divider all the way around.
