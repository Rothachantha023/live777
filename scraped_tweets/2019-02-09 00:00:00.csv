No, point right?
1094384982359851010 2019-02-09 18:58:07 -0400 <Liveoveaugh> @realDonaldTrump Right, as if you are some economic expert. Obama pulled us out of Bush and Bank mess and YOU &amp; SELLOUT GOP gave YOURSELVES a bolstering with massive tax cuts. Greedy bastards. I ain't seeing squat &amp; hear more taxes on mid class are on their way!
1094384982108315648 2019-02-09 18:58:07 -0400 <BrainyMisc> @realDonaldTrump Today, donald trumB, sometimes referred to by me as a total Putz, joined the race for total jerk. He is very highly favored to win. While we have your attention, it should be duly noted that Junior is also a Putz!!!  That is all!
