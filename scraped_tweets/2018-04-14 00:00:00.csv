Meanwhile, the mission to remove you from office remains on track to be accomplished soon,its called #OperationDesertStormy #PeeTape #MissionAccomplished
985305438160859136 2018-04-14 19:54:57 -0400 <ykhalim> Mike Pence is EXTREMELY ignorant, dumb, &amp; stupid! He thinks he is serving God ‚Äì by serving the devil (@realDonaldTrump).

Again, I'm curious if you are close to any liberals, if you have that view.   I think almost all Americans are well-meaning and want the best for people. I'm curious what makes you describe a large group of people like that.

Why not try to work with the president  instead of against him for once. Teach him how to be a frigging crook like the rest of you and maybe he want have to wing it on his own. and then the rest of you can stop trying to be commander and chief.  https://t.co/IeWOq402U1

And someday that cloud will rain or shall I say storm. But looks like everything is going on as planed so I wait.

He owns Democrat politicians and has financial interests in many of our news media outlets. He knows- DIVIDED WE FALL.

I emphatically disagree with the name he called her. I even reported him. I am a lib. I also have a mental illness, severe depression. My illness is not connected to my politics. Please stop using this ignorant language. Mental illness is no joke.
