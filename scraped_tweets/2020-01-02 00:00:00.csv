My kids would do this kind of stuff when they were 7.  You don't get to define me, but you've done a nice job of defining yourself. I'm truly embarrassed for you. You really suck at trolling.  If you're on the spectrum, I'll cut you some slack.

Never mind the interview Larry, you‚Äôre too far gone.  And FYI, it was Iran‚Äôs money, frozen in American and other country's Banks. Multiple countries agreed to the deal. When trump pulled out of the deal, Iran returned to its nuclear program.
