1201288430673711104 2019-12-01 18:54:15 -0400 <iluvbkk> @TomFitton @HeatherNotABot @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Time for some Democrats to draw the line in the sand. Surely, there a quite a few who are not on board with this railroaded impeachment. Time to straighten the backbone and remember you aren‚Äôt working for the DNC but for the people.

1201288417700499456 2019-12-01 18:54:12 -0400 <BlueRobotDesign> @kagforever29 @bthesac @realDonaldTrump Again, you don‚Äôt get to concept of impeachment. Trump will be impeached by the house, the senate will fail to convict and no ones expecting his removal, but he will wear the mark of impeachment. It‚Äôs not debatable. It‚Äôs happening.

You support impeachment.  I‚Äôm asking you for the facts that you‚Äôre basing your opinion on.   The facts that support why the President should be impeached.   Are you still with me?  Again in simpleton terms, what are the facts???
1201288409765097472 2019-12-01 18:54:10 -0400 <Luvnediting> @LeilaWalsh8 @BelkissObadia @ihmike @realDonaldTrump Exactly! I told a MAGA a couple days ago, "Its like the GOP walking into your bank, and taking all the savings you have for retirement and say, "this is ours now, and you cant even call the cops." Its OUR MONEY. You pay into it every month for 30 years. Its Theft, like you said.
