1160339618774028288 2019-08-10 19:58:17 -0400 <JeannePancurak> @realDonaldTrump TRUMP TWEET WARNING: The views and information in a Trump tweet are rarely related to actual facts, and should be deemed to reflect an untruthful interpretation of reality. Trump tweets can be particularly OFFENSIVE, should be read CAUTIOUSLY, and viewed with extreme SKEPTICISM.

The death is an odd coincidence worth investigating by an unbiased third party.
1160339608082821122 2019-08-10 19:58:15 -0400 <TiknisArts> And of course @realDonaldTrump has to join in with a #retweet.  Can we just get a real #POTUS again #America instead of a big #Child?
