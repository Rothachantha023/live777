Trump is being held to higher standards than previous politicians.  I am not worried about "whataboutism", I am very worried about equal justice.  When the dust settles we'll see.

Especially one who has admitted to sexual assault (Access Hollywood), been a predator to undressed teenage girls (Howard Stern), &amp; been accused of rape twice (one was 13 yrs old).

The Queen only gave you 17 mins over tea (every other President had a State Dinner), thousands protest you in London, Scotland and Finland.  You usually cut and run when the going gets tough now is the time go for it!

But they are attacking our country so It's not possible. Just because it's cyber and not bombs doesn't mean it isn't an attack. You're making a huge mistake.

Our DOJ has been so did-honest that I found Putin's request to be genius.  Down with the deep state.  Our President stands strong in a country I no longer recognize.
