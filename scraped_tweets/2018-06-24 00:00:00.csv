1011035729177268224 2018-06-24 19:57:56 -0400 <MichaelAlanUSA> I believe this is called "inciting a riot."  The police, DOJ, @jeffsessions , @realDonaldTrump had better get a handle on this.  It just takes one spark... these communists are getting emboldened because there are no repurcussions to their actions.  Not good.
