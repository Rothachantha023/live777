If Trump thought Ukraine was too corrupt to give aid to, why would he want other nations to give aid to them?  Furthermore, Congress appropriated the aid &amp; set anti-corruption procedure.

1185706641242484736 2019-10-19 19:57:47 -0400 <Denisprings> @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump I might add I‚Äôm also so tired of you. The political thing to do would be to wait until November of next year when democrats will take the presidency and very possibly the Senate too. We are are into the impeachment phase because right thing to do. Trump breaks his oath everyday.  https://t.co/UwBWbF285H

1185706637794787329 2019-10-19 19:57:46 -0400 <imalibsowhat> @realDonaldTrump Y‚Äôall weren‚Äôt concerned about corruption when you stocked the swamp with Tom Price, Ryan Zienke, Scott Pruit, Acosta, Porter and Chao. Those people are corrupt. When else did you withhold funding because of corruption?   Never.
