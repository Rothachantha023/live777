1188606059922907136 2019-10-27 19:59:02 -0400 <LornaWashingt18> @VP @realDonaldTrump Trump proved nothing this guy has been killed by the US soldiers at least 9 times and you know that trump is just   Hiding from the public that he went to court Tuesday to try to take pre existing conditions off our health care.  Hes doing lots of dirt in the dark.

Where does Trump's money come from &amp; how much money was illegally laundered?
1188606059281371136 2019-10-27 19:59:02 -0400 <ellena_chavez> Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.  All on Oct 12, 2012. And same for you..All you said was "O.K.".  Did you not?

1188606057523957761 2019-10-27 19:59:02 -0400 <ellena_chavez> You should not expect credit since you said that of former President Obama. You tweeted:   Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden
1188606055435132928 2019-10-27 19:59:01 -0400 <JohnstonWriter> @stevenwade70 @realDonaldTrump Without knowing anything other than what you have included here, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say "yes, yes he did".   Trump is very, very jealous of Obama's legacy. Because Donnie is not half the man and leader that Obama is, while paradoxically being literally twice the size.
1188606053631647748 2019-10-27 19:59:01 -0400 <ellena_chavez> @realDonaldTrump  Why you choose to give credit to Russia, Turkey, Syria is really beyond me. The American military should have been the first on you list of gratitude. Instead you had Russia, Turkey, Syria, Kurds then the Americans. You don't deserve credit at all, since you..

I don‚Äôt make near that but I hope to one day and why tax them to the point where they make as much as me? Communism. @realDonaldTrump
