False accusations not only hurt innocent men but hurt true victims of sexual assault.  Currently her accusations are vague and can’t be disputed.  There is no evidence.

1042201248815087616 2018-09-18 19:58:35 -0400 <sheppadl> @realDonaldTrump There were people of all races joining together to help neighbors.  There were democrats, republicans and independents alike all working together for the good of our communities. You and all of congress could learn something from us.  We are all Americans helping each other.

It’s at least a 4 out of 10.   Would have been a decent first take.  But “wettest in terms of water”?  English is your native tongue, right?

Completely detached from the reality all around you. So slavery, jim crow, segregation, kkk weren't democrats?  "Near-full unemployment"? So obama had almost everyone unemployed? 😂🤣😂🤣😂 Man, you guys make this too easy!
1042200877057101825 2018-09-18 19:57:06 -0400 <MAlbritton2016> @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Really enjoy your appearances on Fox. But the Pres has the legal authority to do what he has done. I know don’t like it, but the Constitution permits it.
1042200875006087168 2018-09-18 19:57:06 -0400 <1963Carebear> @realDonaldTrump 😢 poor Donnie, those news ppl are always picking on you.....Just kidding, you just hate the TRUTH!!

Obama, in fact, was truthful when he said: "Some jobs just aren't coming back." He was right. The Textile Industry in the U.S. is dead along with many others.

Of course he couldn’t say no... wish I could remember it’s name. It was very funny...
