You touched on Iran Contra.  The GOP have always been the assholes that they are now.  They are just more blatantly corrupt, greedy and know that a functioning democracy is GOP’s greatest fear.

Obstructing an investigation whether there's an underlying crime or not is obstruction of justice.   If the DOJ is not allowed to conduct investigations then they'll never know if a crime is committed or not.   Stop being a tool.

1123738461251489792 2019-05-01 19:58:21 -0400 <grammaevie> @realDonaldTrump Wow bad day for the republicans!!!
1123738458902732800 2019-05-01 19:58:21 -0400 <DeeplyMelanated> Because I haven't said it in a while... @realDonaldTrump is racist trash. Your "president" is trash. Absolute trash. This is based on actual research and documented evidence, not my opinion. Although, my research has made me form the opinion that Trump is trash.

If that gets investigated it will turn out that Obama knowingly allowed interference in US  elections and did nothing. why is this not being investigated?

Trump has instructed Barr to not enforce any subpoenas coming for him &amp; staffers. The GOP would be screaming if it were the Dems ignoring subpoenas. We will remember come voting day. COWARDS ignoring the law.
