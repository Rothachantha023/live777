Drilling, fracking, miles of cable claws rolling back environmental and pollution rules. Seriously you can't think I meant Obama was saving the world from hurricanes. smh
1054884485055971328 2018-10-23 19:57:14 -0400 <Joe69700812> @StephenKing @realDonaldTrump Who all woke up one day with the exact same idea. To march here under their countries flag. What a crazy coincidence.

Would you stop if your family was being threatened, and you had no food and just the shirts on your back, and you or your children  needed medical help. Just what do you think they should be doing? Get real.
1054884474020868097 2018-10-23 19:57:12 -0400 <DriveTrainGuy> @realDonaldTrump Should we tell that guy he was wrong or just wait for him to tweet a video about it?

Try to stick to small words, with only 1-2 syllables. He'll still disagree with you, but at least he'll (probably) be able to read it.  Cheeto üòÇ

1054884461328777217 2018-10-23 19:57:09 -0400 <puppybreath1026> Watching the news and reporters calling him out @realDonaldTrump on many things he has said and no answers was a thing of beauty.
