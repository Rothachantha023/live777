There's still time for you to be a better Human Being and President, but you're going to have to really apply yourself. If you do, you might improve, but don't expect miracles. You're starting so low on the scale and at such a late age.

And maybe your mother should’ve stayed in the British Isles rather than coming here to seek opportunities not present there. You have no right to point fingers.

1148742817348554753 2019-07-09 19:56:44 -0400 <MaryAnnReilly> @realDonaldTrump, his cabinet, and fellow #GOP harm girls and women. They are the party of abusers and protectors of men who rape, assault, and traffic children &amp; women. What utter pigs.
1148742817008803842 2019-07-09 19:56:44 -0400 <BarbaraBayconi1> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Fox is once again disseminating false trumpy propaganda in an effort to mislead the American people. With all environmental programs he has defunded or completely eliminated as well stating global warming isnt real proves he cares nothing for making things great again! POSPOTUS!
1148742816488710144 2019-07-09 19:56:44 -0400 <jkempcpa> @TexasJoeDuck @realDonaldTrump Once you treat Twitter as a public space - Twitter won’t be able to ban anyone.  I don’t think a private company platform should be considered a public space.

1148742811581218818 2019-07-09 19:56:43 -0400 <MBunch3> @RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump No matter how you try to spin it. People are still trying to work two and three jobs to survive. The only ones that are benefiting it’s at 1%. They’re laying off full-time workers and bringing in part time workers with no benefits. Republicans don’t care about workers.  https://t.co/loL7GjKFYQ

If you look closer youll see THIS is the "news &amp; entertainment" account; I DONT follow anyone who DOESNT fit into those categories; &amp; I could care less about "followers" on ANY account.
