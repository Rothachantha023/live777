1079165004174237698 2018-12-29 18:59:21 -0400 <DonaldKelman> @realDonaldTrump You mean the year of the underpaid worker? More accurate would be the year of the over-rewarded 1%, who made millions using the ‚Äújob creation‚Äù funds from the tax breaks etc., for stock buybacks etc. Really, it was the ‚Äúyear of the ultimate scam‚Äù perpetrated by people at the top!

1079164684299849730 2018-12-29 18:58:05 -0400 <Decmbr1203> @realDonaldTrump Are you still harping on this USELESS idea?  Get to real work on real problems that a REAL President should be doing.  Give up thefarce and get to work (if you ever learn how)!  Do you think Democrats will bow to your will? NO!  And 60 percent of the US citizens don't trust you!
1079164683230179328 2018-12-29 18:58:05 -0400 <AlaskanElise> @LoriShownes @realDonaldTrump True, Trumponomics is a disater...and the only thing 2018 will be the year of, is a bunch of sane people gaining weight and developing drinking problems from all the stress of enduring the Trump rein of terror...watching the destruction of our Democracy.

1079164667237359616 2018-12-29 18:58:01 -0400 <LuvMacyIsabella> @realDonaldTrump First of all, you inherited a 4.7% unemployment rate thanks 2 @BarackObama, whereas Obama inherited an unemployment rate of 17.1 thx to Bush. So I wouldn‚Äôt brag 2 much about what you‚Äôve done, u basically just took over the incredible job the most incredible president ever created
1079164666625122304 2018-12-29 18:58:01 -0400 <jenna92821> @realDonaldTrump NJ AG has evidence that managers at Trump‚Äôs golf club gave fraudulent green cards  &amp; Soc. Sec. # to employees.  When evidence was uncovered the AG didn‚Äôt trust Sessions, so they contacted Mueller. The FBI &amp; Mueller are investigating the immigration crimes.  https://t.co/8i4czgUrQM

It is because Mexico refused to give me money, and now I will blame Democrats for my failure! Now we have to do it the hard way, with a Trump Shutdown. Too bad!
