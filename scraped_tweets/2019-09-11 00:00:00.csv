Easy for you to ban this, which I definitely agree with, but if you were making money off of e-cigs, you would be the same as you are about guns. For someone like you, ONLY money talks.

I may not like you, but I'm not going to disagree when I think you're right.  Vaping appears to be very dangerous and should be controlled before becoming a much bigger problem.

It’s because you’re either stupid as shit, or because you’re bought by big tobacco. He is bought by big tobacco, and the NRA.

Drop #Pence, the pseudo-evangelical, you may lose a lot of the #biblebelt #Evangelicals. You think with Nikki you will win the suburbs?   https://t.co/z0DOtuG0Vl

1171935830727954432 2019-09-11 19:57:30 -0400 <Carolin89348039> @realDonaldTrump no one has ever liked you. Those that pretend to only do so for your money, or because u have dirt on them. Why wouldn't you believe the polls? Oh, because u believe ur own b.s. that you have done more than any other president. 🤣 you are sincerely so pathetic.
1171935829855526912 2019-09-11 19:57:30 -0400 <JIMMY4POWERS> All @twitter has become is @realDonaldTrump bashing. You can smell the fear because it's not working anymore.
1171935828995710976 2019-09-11 19:57:29 -0400 <MelanieDuplant3> @realDonaldTrump This American deserves a normal life ... stop the deportation order for my husband
1171935828995706880 2019-09-11 19:57:29 -0400 <StellaStar711> The House keeps allowing @realDonaldTrump to manipulate the Markets.   Obstruction of Justice, Witness Tampering and violating the Emoluments.  @JerryNadler @SpeakerPelosi @RepJeffries   I’m one who refuses to vote and support these crimes.
1171935828634816512 2019-09-11 19:57:29 -0400 <sgeigeresq> Hey @realDonaldTrump fuck you and fuck everyone racist person you have appointed. I hope you rot in hell with Hitler you racist piece of shit.

1171935827120873472 2019-09-11 19:57:29 -0400 <Picapau316> @realDonaldTrump If by all that you have done you meant play golf and destroy America.. then yes you did more than any other president in the first 2 1/2 years as the Oval Office current resident
1171935826814488576 2019-09-11 19:57:29 -0400 <Kleunk> @realDonaldTrump All you do is whine. Geesh! Grow up!
1171935825799499776 2019-09-11 19:57:29 -0400 <tell_truth_now> @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @USGAO Trump has done nothing for this wonderful country except bow to the evangelicals like Falwell who himself sounds like he may have a checkered past. How can you protest to be a Christian &amp; have all the hate displayed by evangelicals?
1171935825681993729 2019-09-11 19:57:29 -0400 <EmilyCragg> @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/xLDGjMJQtj ... Our Pres appears to need an understanding heart, a gentle touch in this conflicted time. Melania is not adapted to deal with intl &amp; cosmic issues--she's a Model, a pretty lady, not her Husband's PEER. COLD--let her move ON.

1171935818094665729 2019-09-11 19:57:27 -0400 <MaxHoberman> @xtinewu @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately this is exactly what so many did in electing him:  "The office is too powerful, and the consequences are too dangerous, to allow a person to become president who views morality only through the prism of whether an action advances his own narrow interests..."

1171935812151328769 2019-09-11 19:57:25 -0400 <cletus1000> @realDonaldTrump Why do you think you need to pat yourself on the back? Repeat after me, “I am the president of the United States.” Whatever happened to you in your youth or whatever slight you’ve experienced, let it go, man. It will destroy you if you don’t.

They never stop investigating. They investigated Benghazi 8 times and that never led to anything. They love investigations, it fires people up. It's got you fired up.

1171935773853020161 2019-09-11 19:57:16 -0400 <NYRBFan> @BlueVotr A president that respects America, the Constitution, and Democracy.  Maybe could have been a bit tougher on our adversaries, but at least he left office with the respect of most Americans - this in contract to the evil that now infests the WH @realDonaldTrump
1171935773152698369 2019-09-11 19:57:16 -0400 <GoodthrustJohn> @realDonaldTrump Democrats have become chronic complainers. When Trump tries to solve something, like these reforms, they whine. When they see bad overflowing centers, they whine. They can never admit they could’ve fixed this issue long before Trump became President! #MAGA

It’s easy to get them confused but we shouldn’t perpetuate stereotypes. 🦑
