It doesn‚Äôt mean she agreed w/them, which doesn‚Äôt mean Trump agreed w/white supremacists. The sad fact is most ethnic supremacists are on the left: BLM, Antifa, Black Panthers, LaRaza, etc.

933484208504307712 2017-11-22 18:55:53 -0400 <commish625> @realDonaldTrump Aren't you friends with Don King?  How is that an insult and why are you wasting time dealing with Ball?  Don't you have MANY more important things to do?
933484208386924544 2017-11-22 18:55:53 -0400 <TimGranite> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I had two wonderful bowel movements today. The most I've had in 12 years. Upper and lower colons moved things along very smoothly. Thank you Donald Dump.

933484196647133184 2017-11-22 18:55:50 -0400 <TheeRockSchool> @Lavarbigballer with this spotlight,  call @realDonaldTrump Every fitting adjective: fraud, liar, buffoon, egomaniac, narcissist old fart.
933484192758874112 2017-11-22 18:55:49 -0400 <colorada52> @LazyDeatheater @realDonaldTrump Looks like you have no idea of the composition of the Argentinean population. As Americans, we have the indigenous people but mostly we descend from Europeans, Italians and Spaniards. Sorry to disappoint you.

933484188975665152 2017-11-22 18:55:48 -0400 <Dennisjankowsk6> @QuackerDad @Stretchomarx @WeCartoon @traceyaaron3 @realDonaldTrump You are right Obama was really just a punchline. He was good for a laugh every now and then then but completely out of his league as president. Trump is correcting all of the ills of the country and is making America great again.
933484187696242689 2017-11-22 18:55:48 -0400 <R2D2Mom> @realDonaldTrump Unless you‚Äôre planning to gift Mar-a-Lago to the American people to become an official government building that future presidents will use, it is NOT the ‚ÄúWinter White House‚Äù.
