961025902212763649 2018-02-06 18:56:44 -0400 <Lindalo62382451> @realDonaldTrump You need to stop worrying  about s gang most people never heard of!! Instead try doing your job!! Just heard you boosting that you want 2 shutdown the government because you think it will make the democrats look bad! Do you know how many veterans work for the government?
961025901684178944 2018-02-06 18:56:44 -0400 <Pat_Riot_21> @Kandee1970 @realDonaldTrump Is already been adjudicated through SCOTUS that would bed a violation of 1A.   What might work though is a limit on how much a candidate can SPEND in a campaign and they can't keep any excess. For subsequent campaigns nor transfer it to other candidates.
961025900606382080 2018-02-06 18:56:44 -0400 <millien_pierre> @realDonaldTrump Ok you have the MS13 talking point down packed what else you got ?
961025899071180805 2018-02-06 18:56:43 -0400 <EddyGarner1> @TalbertSwan @HopeRadio1 @realDonaldTrump Oh look we have a Jesse Jackson wannabe! Have you ever heard of taking the high road? If you think Trump is so awful and racist then you run for president and we‚Äôll see if there still is racism in this country if you get elected.

961025891819122688 2018-02-06 18:56:42 -0400 <M5B1tch> @SabrinaCath @noxeout @JosephORourke7 @TinaKL6 @SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump They had to do a LOT more than just take an oath. They had to back everything up with multitudes of evidence proving each of their assertions. That FISA warrant is said to be 50 pages long! Cherrypicking again w/McCabe statement.Multiple ppl have said he did not say that
961025891391467521 2018-02-06 18:56:42 -0400 <activeshow> @GovMikeHuckabee @toby_dorena @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Mike you just let out the script to a killer comedy.

961025889600405506 2018-02-06 18:56:41 -0400 <GEEPENNIN> @realDonaldTrump Your own lawyers called you a liar and refuse to put you in a room with Mueller, because you can't be trusted to tell the truth. How incredibly pathetic is that?
961025886010183680 2018-02-06 18:56:40 -0400 <carmen_caldas> @TravisAllen02 @realDonaldTrump It's to make up for all the Democrats who didn't clap for him. He needs the adulation.  So pathetic.

The bottom keeps dropping lower with each outrage. Yes, we must encourage others to vote in all 2018 elections, but there should be enough sane people in the house and senate who CARE about what's happening!
961025876195385344 2018-02-06 18:56:38 -0400 <LostDiva> @Carolin11913904 @realDonaldTrump but #PodestaGroup is OUT OF BUSINESS. #NeverHillary #NeverTrump
