So  as im. texting you this message on gun control, I got an news alert on my phone hone that 5 people where killed in yet another mass shooting. It’s so normal now my reaction is more like “ oh only 5, I guess his AR must have jammed”. Very very sad!!!!
1096559595378614272 2019-02-15 18:59:15 -0400 <givemeliberty22> @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Yes keep guns out of the hands of illegal aliens and criminals. There hasn't been any homicide or mass shooting committed by a law bidding citizen. Those who think no one should own firearms should immediately go and turn theirs in. Or sell it to one pf us WeThePeople Patriots.

1096559298421968896 2019-02-15 18:58:04 -0400 <MummyBarrow> 38th mass shooting in America this year happened today.    38 mass shootings in 46 days.     Yet you keep focusing on that bloody wall @realDonaldTrump rather than Americans murdering each other
1096559298010849280 2019-02-15 18:58:04 -0400 <TheatreGirl79> Today I watched two forms of breaking news on the television. One was @realDonaldTrump talking about an "emergency" with a wall, and looking joyfully at the people in the front row he was excited about putting out of a job. The other was a gunman killing (1/2)

1096559271867760640 2019-02-15 18:57:58 -0400 <GeneralZod1978> @realDonaldTrump Gotta love empty platitudes.  If an illegal gets caught commiting a crime, Trump rages on twitter, demands billions, calls it a crisis, shuts the government down and abuses executive power.  Tens of thousands die yearly to guns and Trump sends them a half assed twitter message.

So there’s a few people out there that really don’t give a shit about his sincerity. Thoughts and prayers to him on his spam problem.
