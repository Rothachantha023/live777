You were best mates with Noonan while he danced a jig for Trump in Shannon as he snapped up Doonbeg for a song. Have you any principles? When you were in Gov. you had none.

Why should anyone believe this is not another. Anyone complaining so much about the "fake news" and alleged dishonesty of the press would have to be an idiot to say something in front of them that he didn't want published. Oh.

1035678059100340224 2018-08-31 19:57:45 -0400 <goldbars_andARs> @gentlefaesoul @realDonaldTrump I see no tweet of DJT's that warrants shielding from a 9 year old. Nor is there any evidence of any guilt whatsoever. Seems like you're judging and convinced that Trump is guilty of something devoid of any evidence to support your conclusions.  Unless you have something on him.

Considering what T-RUmp may have done with Putin, don't rule out that T-RUmp &amp; at least 1/3rd of nation wouldn't have a problem if T-RUmp sold the nation out to the Axis if Hitler named T-RUmp as Emperor of the Americas.   https://t.co/h2RxA3d0hA

You are the most famous person alive at this point.  If I were you, I would assume most everything I said was public.  It is inescapable.  Loyalty is dead.  You yourself should know.  Good luck!

The Judiciary Committee actually warned him they might not consider a replacement any time soon. Did not want to be stuck solely with RR that long.

1035677795727429632 2018-08-31 19:56:43 -0400 <Kalabrell> @realDonaldTrump A man, able to carry the weight of negativity from the inconsiderate, inherits a strong will to conquer every challenge that dares to face him. Fortunately, we have a president just like that.

1035677765251387392 2018-08-31 19:56:35 -0400 <Sullyflyer> @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump @DrewForOklahoma .The last Democrat I voted for (obama)  screwed things up so bad.   Why didn't he  fix the immigration mess in the 8 years he was in office.   Why didn't he fix DACA, thereby leaving recipients in limbo?  Why did he kick the proverbial can down the road?  Vote Republican .
