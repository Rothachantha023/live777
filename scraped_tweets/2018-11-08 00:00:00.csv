1060682243411247104 2018-11-08 18:55:28 -0400 <Trump4M> @realDonaldTrump PRESS CONFERENCES: Have each person pick a number and that is the order they get to ask questions.  Then it is fair to all members of the press not just the obnoxious sensationalists. Why does Acosta always get to ask a question. There must be RESPECT and ORDER!

In violation of multiple statutes! Then Whitaker can serve temporarily without Senate approval for not meeting one of their "rules" that are overlooked by both parties on a regular basis.

He was in Vietnam as was my uncle. Uncle still alive. No one helped my cousin or gave him the respect for his service. Not my place to judge the gold star family. I am sick of liberals getting outraged constantly.

1060682201073889280 2018-11-08 18:55:17 -0400 <JimHollywood> @realDonaldTrump The midterms actually reaffirmed confidence in the President.   Poor Dem showing.  Arguably with fraudulent attempts to steal elections.

1060682195696783362 2018-11-08 18:55:16 -0400 <Midwood49> @JacksonLeeTX18 @realDonaldTrump Democrats encouraging protests against the President for something that you think he “may” do, is dangerous and divisive.
1060682195394875392 2018-11-08 18:55:16 -0400 <SammyJo58> @realDonaldTrump is a pu$$y and is afraid of reporters. During questioning by @Acosta yesterday, he paced around the podium like a caged animal. He doesn’t believe in the First Amendment - unless it refers to his own freedom to spout hate speech 😡
1060682191607336960 2018-11-08 18:55:15 -0400 <jadedview> @beth1972inUSA @Jossfjh @realDonaldTrump 40 years+. Actually we can trace it back to Prescott Bush &amp; his alliance with John Rockefeller.
