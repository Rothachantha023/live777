1159615190016524288 2019-08-08 19:59:40 -0400 <SuperStarGroper> @kylegriffin1 When @realDonaldTrump says "racist", it's a #dogwhistle to his followers that he is #gaslighting, so they get on-board and start repeating the #gaslighting lies as well. In @gop logic, the more often something is said, the truer it becomes.  Total nonsense. Need a real president.
1159615188678541312 2019-08-08 19:59:40 -0400 <laura_blaylock> @realDonaldTrump I agree" there is much more to his story than they allowed him to say!

They left because they saw their job as serving our nation, while Trump felt their job was serving him. He ignored U.S. intelligence, going against it and siding with despots like Putin and Kim Jong-un. We are so screwed.

Otherwise, it doesn't matter. Laws get in the way of "good" people who suffer for no reason.  🙄  Legalities, and politics are all a joke.  We need an overhaul.

But I thought 14 yrs was a lot then considering the corruption by so many others that got nothing. He was singled out as an example. Political cost to u for early release? That’s the manure in politics.
