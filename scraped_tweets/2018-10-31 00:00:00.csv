Trump's proposal goes DIRECTLY AGAINST AMENDMENT #14 of the Constitution, just as Ryan stated. It's called Checks &amp; Balances. Here's a link:  https://t.co/7spbLHNOWX

They had an influx and they learned the best way to deal with it:  Allow refugees to have their asylum cases heard in costa rica. Trump ended that policy because he needs to rile up his base.

He must have gotten in when the Republicans were on vacation --- like the last 10 years. I bet there was never a single Republican registered person who murdered someone.

You just can't stand the fact that most local Pittsburgh government officials refused to meet with you, so you have to denigrate them in some way. Too bad nobody was there to meet the President of the United States at the airport. Take a hint, you clueless demagogue.
