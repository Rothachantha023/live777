Now we will pay for EU tariffs too. Trump takes the credit as we pay the price. As for jobs, it‚Äôs a continuation from Obama.

Ok I really don‚Äôt like name calling our fellow citizens on social media.That said I find it funny when people use jobs created as a reason why trump is wonderful. Yet Obama and Clinton with higher job creation numbers are of the devil.
