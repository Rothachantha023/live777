1218684423027163136 2020-01-18 18:59:43 -0400 <BarbaraElledge8> @realDonaldTrump If your so great why have you been impeached?
1218684422532337669 2020-01-18 18:59:43 -0400 <IAmAPearlGirl> @gtconway3d They chose their president. Now their chosen one has to stand trial in the Senate for doing things to get himself impeached. The choosers should be mad at @realDonaldTrump - not anyone else. HE made his choices, now he has to live with them.

1218684055962693634 2020-01-18 18:58:15 -0400 <UKmaninNY> @realDonaldTrump Have you read Julius Caesar. Beware the Ides of January for the Senate might have the knife for you &amp; impeach you. Julius Caesar who was more intelligent than you but as deluded thought Rome loved him, like you think GOP/ US loves you, but who knows you could be impeached
1218684055648112640 2020-01-18 18:58:15 -0400 <DRils> @realDonaldTrump @TheLastRefuge2 OK, so maybe Pelosi, Wasserman, Hillary, and the DNC may have deked out Bernie a couple of times, but Vlad and Xi would never outfox ol‚Äô Bernie.
