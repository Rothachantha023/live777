1093297468849168384 2019-02-06 18:56:43 -0400 <sandrajfrank> @realDonaldTrump One would not have a heart if they did not feel compassion for the people you brought to the #SOTU. Just a few hours before without a script, you were spewing hatred towards the Democrats. It hard to believe @realDonaldTrump - you have lied so many times.
