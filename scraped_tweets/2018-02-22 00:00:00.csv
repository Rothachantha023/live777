In Ca they can only have 10 bullets in their AR just like a semi auto. Also most of the AR shootings are with in 50 feet. At this distance I win. I am trained LEO. Puke plays video games.
966824921140793346 2018-02-22 18:59:58 -0400 <banalyst> Trump believes school employees like the soccer coach killed at Parkland could‚Äôve been effective if he‚Äôd had a gun. Would he carry the gun at all times? On the pitch? Or would he leave it lying around? Either way, why can‚Äôt @realDonaldTrump see what a fucking stupid idea this is?
966824919848947713 2018-02-22 18:59:58 -0400 <ShelleyMcElyea1> @realDonaldTrump  If schools are ever NOT considered gun free zones, there's going to be a massive jump in homeschooling. I'd rather have a child that may not be as educated, rather than a dead one.

The gun cult is causing the security problem by pressing for easy access to war weaponry, so let them pay for security. Thank you for accepting this sensible solution.

966824215113433088 2018-02-22 18:57:10 -0400 <perconstantine> @realDonaldTrump Real life is not a fucking action movie. Even trained police officers only have an accuracy rating of about 30%. And that's when the suspect isn't returning fire. And who's going to pay to train and equip these teachers? You? I doubt it. #NRAwhore. #dontarmteachers

Problem solved.  But I get the impression Liberals, including this student mouthpiece,  aren't looking for solutions.
