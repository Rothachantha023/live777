By contrast, Mitch is currently sitting on over 400 bills, including a major bill to reduce the cost of prescription jobs - which would undoubtedly receive bipartisan support on the Senate floor.

1207812546264215559 2019-12-19 18:58:45 -0400 <Catladyonahill> @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump The Speedy Trial Clause of the 6th Amendment provides that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy trial. It protects the defendant from delay between the presentation of the indictment and the beginning of trial!
