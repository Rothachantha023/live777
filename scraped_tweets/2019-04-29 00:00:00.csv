But that was earlier today...  that number has already grown...thanks to the liars Trump and his supporters the @GOP and evangelicals.  Sad, eh?

Cutting regulations doesn't take a genius, just someone who doesn't care about people or environment. Unions are what made middle class. Their demise sad.
