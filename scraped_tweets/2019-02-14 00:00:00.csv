They don't realize you where just using it as a fear tactic to get elected. Now look at them in the comment section fearing for their lives that they might not the get "the wall" you made them chant for. So sad!  https://t.co/o7hm79RKdG

I know, not a ‘fashionable’ trend with liberals who refuse to accept the fraud of #globalwarming. How much do you think carbon credits could impact a bare 1% temp increase in 100yrs? #BlindersPlease

1096196865991811072 2019-02-14 18:57:53 -0400 <FreeholdTjg> @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump According to the Federal Register, 58 national emergencies have been declared since the National Emergency Act of 1976 was signed into law by President Gerald Ford. And 31 have been annually renewed and are currently still in effect, as listed in the Federal Register.
