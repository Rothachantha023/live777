If Trump declares National Emergency while we are in a dangerous crisis, that's not good also and probably a mistake to do. Looks like it's not time for #TheWall.

That is going to look real bad for you. But that's what you will be remembered for. Keep it up, you make the Dems look good! Chuck Schumer wasn't the only one who said you had a temper tantrum.

1083875762091032576 2019-01-11 18:58:13 -0400 <LovingL94558871> @JuanUlloa @SenSchumer @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Tell Schumer to open the govt. He has the ability to open it and you know it. If you are really suffering you would ask anyone to do anything to open the govt including Schumer. Shame on you for not doing your part to re-open govt. Call your reps &amp; tell them to make a deal.
