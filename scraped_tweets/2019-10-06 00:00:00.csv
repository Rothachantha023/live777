They are all working for taxpayer funded organizations that are available to all- A.K.A. Socialist programs. Thanks for playing.  https://t.co/IbP1ag3e0I

1180995943774216193 2019-10-06 19:59:09 -0400 <PAAZRepublican> @realDonaldTrump @60Minutes Of course they did.  They also didn‚Äôt mention that most farmers support you regarding the negotiations with China

She is blood @GOP red through &amp; through &amp; one moment of clarity (is it?) doesn't wipe away years of sticking it to America. Class A phony.
1180995940443967489 2019-10-06 19:59:08 -0400 <AnotherFour_45> @realDonaldTrump MSM is not an honest broker worthy of American trust.  The trust is gone until a new system of objective information is built.

1180995936585207809 2019-10-06 19:59:07 -0400 <srlpete> @realDonaldTrump I believe it‚Äôs all the crimes you‚Äôve committed that are the impeachable offenses. This is country of laws, not some Orange Republic.
1180995936564039680 2019-10-06 19:59:07 -0400 <Kats_GA> @realDonaldTrump @WSJatLarge That‚Äôs because it doesn‚Äôt include all the women you‚Äôve sexually assaulted, raped, used Mar-A-Lago for Epstein‚Äôs sex trafficking ring and your new Chinese sex trafficker.  All Starr was dealing with was consensual sex.

They need to meet with Trump to show that the U.S. backs the Ukraine against Russian invasion. Quid pro quo is exactly what happened.

1180995934278189056 2019-10-06 19:59:07 -0400 <aguilar_m11> @realDonaldTrump @60Minutes Taxpayers are paying for this bullshit.

He did not meet them. He was not looking specifically for corruption and he made that clear the first couple days.
1180995934165114881 2019-10-06 19:59:07 -0400 <JustFactsSG810> @DogginTrump @realDonaldTrump You wish that garbage was true but it‚Äôs clearly not. If he actually did anything to steal the election, he would no longer be president. And he is. Thank God for that.

Just like you didn't want to see that your Dad's tax fraud-sourced money was what started you on this dark, corrupt path. Sad...very sad.

1180995930834817025 2019-10-06 19:59:06 -0400 <benjamnfrankly> @realDonaldTrump Mr. President,what I would do is ask A.G.Barr to assign a special prosecutor to the Ukranian/ Biden Situation.Have this guy investigate both sides. U didn't do anything illegal or corrupt so you dont have to worry but this will have the deep state &amp; fake media dropping brisks
