I can't decide if you don't understand or don't care, probably both.

Never once complained. Innocent people are not afraid to testify.  https://t.co/Ok4fZeEFET
1127362051775635456 2019-05-11 19:57:13 -0400 <col_evil> @realDonaldTrump It took awhile to get Gotti, but he was Gotten. You are next ... does that mean you‚Äôll be Trumpen? Start learning some blues - it‚Äôll come in handy when you‚Äôre skin tone matches your jumpsuit.  Color contrast will be desirable when you are institutionalized.
1127362050114629635 2019-05-11 19:57:12 -0400 <24sales2U> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Yep, American producers can raise their prices even more with less competition. Good thing the GOP is fighting to keep wages suppressed. If you can't afford a new one heck with that, call a repairman, if you can afford one.
1127362049934336001 2019-05-11 19:57:12 -0400 <Heathhooperstar> @realDonaldTrump if this report exonerates you, seems like you‚Äôd want him to testify &amp; ppl to read it. Same w taxes!  https://t.co/ujvWYLm4zZ

1127362048835358720 2019-05-11 19:57:12 -0400 <JerseyDutchGirl> @realDonaldTrump Saying China is paying for tariffs is like saying Mexico is paying for the wall.
1127362046935224320 2019-05-11 19:57:12 -0400 <markgraham925> @realDonaldTrump You need to study economics and sociology you luddite. The USA is well into the post industrial phase. The average factory worker in China makes $3.60/hour. The average in the US is $11.66/hour. Your tariffs won‚Äôt change that fact and will drive inflation here. You are horrible

1127362046033649664 2019-05-11 19:57:11 -0400 <JonnyMoorehead> @realDonaldTrump Only a fool would listen to business advice from a serial bankrupted failure. #Brokeahontas  https://t.co/S4LbKvHBNc
1127362045844738053 2019-05-11 19:57:11 -0400 <lorne_sinclair> @ColMorrisDavis @realDonaldTrump Big tariffs paid by consumers.

1127362041549852673 2019-05-11 19:57:10 -0400 <1jwilkes> @robertjeffress @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness Israel is allied with Saudi‚Äôs on Kashoggi murder; has embraced the terrorist right on Palestine. They are major money launderers.  And attacked a US Navy ship USS Liberty. I‚Äôm an American.  You are conflicted

1127362035141021698 2019-05-11 19:57:09 -0400 <MischiefDragone> @KamVTV @realDonaldTrump Trump spits bullshit with no evidence like three million voting illegally, his net worth and how a good of a business man he was
