985668705601445888 2018-04-15 19:58:26 -0400 <TheDog79241038> @realDonaldTrump A new ABC News/Washington Post poll shows that 56% of Americans disapprove of the President's job performance, while 40% approve. Those who strongly disapprove of Trump outnumber those who strongly approve by two to one.  I am amazed you are doing this well.  #leadershipmatters

I'll be watching Comey's interview tonight and I've alread reserved my copy of his book for Tuesday

When the history of the #Trumpolini incumbancy is written people will marvel at how America managed to self-harm so spectacularly. #Trumpolini and #VladamirPutin deserve each other in so many ways.
985667973829492737 2018-04-15 19:55:32 -0400 <pleromazero> @realDonaldTrump tuiteó 50 veces sobre @Comey, mientras que el exdirector del @FBI sólo una sobre @POTUS: @LouiseMensch.

985667941428477952 2018-04-15 19:55:24 -0400 <turner_nel> @realDonaldTrump Coming from a man that claims he wouldn't announce when he's going to strike but you took the liberty of tweeting to Russia what was coming. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to notice that, that was an all out announcement. "New" and "smart"? Really?
985667940472127488 2018-04-15 19:55:24 -0400 <tomlacovara> @realDonaldTrump #Assad protects #Christians sir, and this was not #Constitutional. I will stand with you when you are right, but I am not alone in saying this was absolutely wrong. How about bombing the real oppressors - #SaudiArabia
