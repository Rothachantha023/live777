1146206245608669185 2019-07-02 19:57:19 -0400 <DippinDots6> @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Well Nancy just start the freaking impeachment hearings and stop tweeting. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU. YOU are letting him slide on it all.
1146206245323325440 2019-07-02 19:57:19 -0400 <JeffSkolnik> @realDonaldTrump Why are you worried if you did nothing wrong?

Nike can make any decision they want. Tax incentives are at elected officials decretion. I think it would've been a popular shoe.
1146206240336416768 2019-07-02 19:57:17 -0400 <LindaMeredithFL> Are you seeing this @realDonaldTrump ? You‚Äôve been played.

1146206237731647488 2019-07-02 19:57:17 -0400 <SallySelner> @realDonaldTrump Only following your example of thumbing your nose at anyone.  You don't get respect when you sit in any office (and most of all the oval office) unless you deserve it.  You my fool don't deserve it.

1146206234867130368 2019-07-02 19:57:16 -0400 <NWTPapaBear> Good.  Dictator military events should not be aired. @realDonaldTrump

Their own President siding with a murdering dictator &amp; supporting the lies stating Jong-Un was unaware of Ottos physical state, as if their sons life is irrelevant. All the support &amp; love to Ottos family.....
