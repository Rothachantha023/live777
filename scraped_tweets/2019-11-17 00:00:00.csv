He also likes to use the word 'we' when he defends himself to include all Republicans. I believe if most were asked, they don't truly support him, his behavior is increasingly indefensible.

1196216151606538245 2019-11-17 18:58:49 -0400 <TruthByTZ> @realDonaldTrump Intimidating a witness is also an impeachable offense. It is a constitutional requirement not an option to #ImpeachTrump. The #25thAmendment is far more merciful than the reality of the impending impeachment.  Failure to remove Trump at this point is treason.
