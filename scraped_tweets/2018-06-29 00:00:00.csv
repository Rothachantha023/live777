1012847386446659585 2018-06-29 19:56:49 -0400 <Rainydog11> @newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump Well Sir.  The Asst Director is questionable to this entire bullshit investigation.  Time to fire him and AG Sessions.

Our entire government is dysfunctional and the President his administration &amp; some in Congress are under federal investigation for collusion, conspiracy, and acts of subversion and treason.

Will it be worth it? I don't know, but we do know as long as Trump can brag about it he doesn't care how much you in Wis. paid.
