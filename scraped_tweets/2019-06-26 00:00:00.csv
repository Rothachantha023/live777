1144032217435262981 2019-06-26 19:58:30 -0400 <1Lelia> @realDonaldTrump The crisis you proclaimed initially was due to drug dealers, hoodlams, gangs, and terrorists coming across our unprotected borders. The Democrats always denounced the harsh treatment of immigrants as a result of your inhumane orders.There is a big difference. Tell the truth.
