964650592172953600 2018-02-16 18:59:58 -0400 <kennorkin> @realDonaldTrump Truth is, @realDonaldTrump, that while Russia launched their anti-US campaign in 2014 BEFORE your announcement, you formed your Presidential campaign exploratory committee in 2013.

I could have picked these same names from the Russian phone book if I had know how he was going to roll over on the American people. It's an expensive slap in the face!

They are being dealt with strongly by law enforcement.  Specifically, Robert Mueller and he's not done yet.  Maybe you better go ahead and fire him.

Social services will take on that task.

Of course they say we voted for Trump because of hashtags - that‚Äôs how easily liberals are manipulated, so they assumed that with us. I‚Äôd definitely advise you to avoid MSM - bunch of unprofessional clowns. üòÜ

Dead and traumatized kids and here you come with your orange face, terrible speaking skills and complete lack of empathy.   Please POTUS don't use tonight to talk about Russia!   And 10 to 1 you'll be on the golf course by tomorrow afternoon. Pig
964650074071584768 2018-02-16 18:57:54 -0400 <WiggerVicki> @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Exactly....they're trying to remove the spotlight from them
964650073513742336 2018-02-16 18:57:54 -0400 <Manqueman> @realDonaldTrump So your answer is to make it easier for the disturbed to buy weapons including assault rifles? You're a genius.

964650071051702272 2018-02-16 18:57:53 -0400 <sherc1948> @realDonaldTrump Time to ‚Äòzip your lips‚Äô and let Congress come up with a joint solution.  THEN SIGN IT WITHOUT giving your worthless 2 cents.  You did say you would sign anything they came up with as a compromise!!!
964650070464397313 2018-02-16 18:57:53 -0400 <ProjectMayhem29> @JasonBrodie7 @realDonaldTrump That was his conclusion. If you don't like it, fine. There is no evidence of any collusion. Maybe there will be in future but as it stands, there isn't,

964650063535529989 2018-02-16 18:57:52 -0400 <tina_eager> @Reuters Have the families of the kids affected said they don't want to see him or is @realDonaldTrump too much of a coward to go and see them?
964650062822367232 2018-02-16 18:57:51 -0400 <testweeter3> Trump too got 30 millions directly and indirectly from the NRA towards his campaign. So he is bought and paid for by NRA and rich folks + Putin  @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @vp @FLOTUS  @CNN @GOP @DNC @MSNBC Every republican must go - send them packing  https://t.co/sbW8yjQV7G

964650061459312640 2018-02-16 18:57:51 -0400 <GBettick> @BigwheelMcNeil @realDonaldTrump @PutinRF_Eng A majority of gun deaths are suicides. Out of the 30,000 gun related deaths, I believe it's roughly 20,000 suicides. Then there are justified police shootings. The number of gun related homicides is roughly 8,000 and a huge majority is from DC, Chi, NYC &amp; LA.
