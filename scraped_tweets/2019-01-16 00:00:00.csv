Maybe give up this wall argument, and instead install an invisible fence around the whole United States and make everyone whose not American wear shock collars so they can’t cross illegally

That's why he holds dozens of rallies for his MAGA cult instead of performing the duties of a leader. Smart move of @SpeakerPelosi to take that away from him.  If only @senatemajldr would also stand up to Trump.

1085687962057101312 2019-01-16 18:59:15 -0400 <rellik68> @chelseahandler @realDonaldTrump has a history of not paying employees/contractors for completed work.  Did anyone expect anything else from someone who would think that the DOJ and the AG are his personal lawyer and police force?  Next 🍄rump will claim those workers shouldn't get back pay.

Why did he leave $1.6b in wall funding in 2018 unused?  Trump is the one unwilling to compromise &amp; throwing a tantrum about it.  He won't back down, so the majority see it as #TrumpShutdown #worstnegotiatorever

1085687722797232128 2019-01-16 18:58:18 -0400 <Randal_Jackson> I really hope I can make my flight next week, this gov shutdown is some bullshit. @realDonaldTrump stop the shutdown you orange chicken, saggy face, baby hand, racist, fast food eating, cash poor, limp dick, bald comb over old bastard.
1085687722168209409 2019-01-16 18:58:18 -0400 <PatiWoodburn> @realDonaldTrump you really have her scared now! @SpeakerPelosi really doesn't want you to have the State of the Union until after the government re-opens! I guess she doesn't realize when she agrees to border security the government will re-open! #SillyWoman
1085687722138730497 2019-01-16 18:58:18 -0400 <AndrewKaplan35> @ewarren @realDonaldTrump Should but won't. They wouldn't even vote to keep sanctions in place on Oleg Deripaska &amp; McTurtle refuses to even let the Senate vote to reopen government until Trump pre-approves the bill. With all of the checks and balances in place, it only took 2 years to destroy the country.
1085687722055032834 2019-01-16 18:58:18 -0400 <stu302> @realDonaldTrump Close the border, send in the military.

1085687718926082049 2019-01-16 18:58:17 -0400 <tristanspeak> @BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Jr. loved it. Wished he'd been treated so royalky by his dad.
1085687715398631424 2019-01-16 18:58:17 -0400 <gordonr2k13> @realDonaldTrump Democrats passed 700 miles of NEW fencing along the southern boarder last year. You refused. So we offer you 100 miles less than ALL OF EUROPE, $24 BILLION for border security and it wasn't good enough. It's the exact same 700 miles Democrats approved under Obama. You just don't

When was the last time he was there? Thanksgiving? Before Epstein news broke again the first week of Dec? Are we sure he isn’t dodging anything down there?

1085687624071897088 2019-01-16 18:57:55 -0400 <CucuillinSkyes> @realDonaldTrump must let @SpeakerPelosi know she is not the President and she does not make Presidential decisions.
1085687622788399104 2019-01-16 18:57:55 -0400 <inglamwetrust> Maybe @LindseyGrahamSC would like to hold endless Benghazi style Congressional hearings, since he believes @realDonaldTrump is responsible for the deaths of 4 #US #military by his weak Syria policy &amp; his &amp; @VP's lies about #ISIS being defeated. 🤔 #MAGA

1085687615305719809 2019-01-16 18:57:53 -0400 <SquatchyWoman> @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SecretService Nancy, why are you still getting paid? Build the wall, slats, provide security to the country. U.S. Citizens being murder by illegals may not concern you, but it concerns Americans. Remember Americans???
1085687613443489793 2019-01-16 18:57:52 -0400 <nmpforever> Is @RepMarkMeadows talking about HYPOCRISY??!!  #TRAITORS  @Jim_Jordan  @realDonaldTrump  More #MuellerInvestigation indictments coming

1085687608066351105 2019-01-16 18:57:51 -0400 <kiddieteacher> @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump And as a democrat, I resent the fact that the president has chosen to only represent one party.  Since when are we a one party nation?
1085687607072149504 2019-01-16 18:57:51 -0400 <vpak13> @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump yeah and he said if I like my doctor I can keep him!! Oh waiiit !!!  https://t.co/yKsuQazQt0
1085687606086651904 2019-01-16 18:57:51 -0400 <B_Mo_Mom> @realDonaldTrump Please give the State of the Union Address! The democrats are so afraid of you addressing the American people. Don’t let them make demands on you! We want to hear all that has been done these past two years and we want America to know the dems are obstructing you!

U offer what U think they should have; .@realDonaldTrump gave them what they want. Can’t see trees through the Forrest

1085687601875554306 2019-01-16 18:57:50 -0400 <marykathrynem> @realDonaldTrump Thank you for following through on Obama's recommendationon stopping illegal immigration and thank you for the government shut down..... the longer it's closed the more obvious it is that most of these government positions aren't really needed.

1085687600533438477 2019-01-16 18:57:49 -0400 <JWr1ghtBra1n> @Franklin_Graham @realDonaldTrump Yes the nation’s Muslims, Hindus, Atheists and Satanists agree.

They need to stand down and strike until they’re again treated as valued employees #TSAStrike

And recall he created a mess by establishing DACA.  That was far beyond his authority as President.  But, because he was a Dem it was all good.

You're pulling numbers out of thin air and if that was the case no one would have signed up and we know that's not the case millions have signed up. This isn't a secret its public record.
