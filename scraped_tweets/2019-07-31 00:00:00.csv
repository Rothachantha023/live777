1156715690541375488 2019-07-31 19:58:06 -0400 <Rcrooks1969> @realDonaldTrump BS the Fed never lowers interest rates when the economy is doing well. For good reason: if interest rates are near rock bottom in good times, the Fed will have no means of addressing a recession.

In fact, @realDonaldTrump is the best President I've seen in my lifetime and I dont give a damn what Democrats think of him or me.
