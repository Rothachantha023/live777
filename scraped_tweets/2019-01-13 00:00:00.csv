1084600525721464833 2019-01-13 18:58:10 -0400 <Nocwizard> @realDonaldTrump Yes elections do have consequences so you should understand the Republicans lost control of Congress because Dems promised no wall money for you.
1084600525709082624 2019-01-13 18:58:10 -0400 <3LegChair> @Miduswell @ellievan65 @realDonaldTrump I thought they believed everyone who isn’t in heaven will be in hell. Under these circumstances, why would heaven need a wall? Will there be undocumented people from hell getting in? So many questions that don’t line up with their theology
1084600525646106627 2019-01-13 18:58:10 -0400 <blainehoffman> @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump And that’s not how this works. Show me the evidence that he is working for Russia. I love your talking points it’s so easy to see how pathetic you are. You don’t prove your innocence in this country you prove there guilt. But u know that already

1084600523620155394 2019-01-13 18:58:10 -0400 <ashkaapuni> @realDonaldTrump Grow a pair. For reals. Stop being such a bully and quit demanding a wall when it was not the majority vote. You lost. Pull up your big girl panties and suck it up. Please. Sir.
