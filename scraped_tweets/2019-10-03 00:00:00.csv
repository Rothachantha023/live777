1179908552334417920 2019-10-03 19:58:15 -0400 <mom49of3> News flash @LindseyGrahamSC the American ppl are watching and we're not falling for the Putin playbook of conspiracy theories from you, or @realDonaldTrump. The @SenateGOP and @HouseGOP has allowed Trump to abuse our Constitution and put our national security interests at risk.

Im genuinely hurt and confused by Evangelical community willingness to invoke Jesus yet uplift someone who daily vomits lies and spews hate.
1179908546571448320 2019-10-03 19:58:13 -0400 <therealltlkrow> @realDonaldTrump @RepLeeZeldin Nope. It's just not working Fat Bubba. Not only are you going to be impeached but the fools who go on Fox and defend you need to be investigated. Only another guilty person could possibly defend you at this point. #ImpeachmentIsInevitable

1179908541731069952 2019-10-03 19:58:12 -0400 <BonespursSpace> @realDonaldTrump trdump supporters have decided their biggest enemy is the Democratic Party..  They don‚Äôt care if trdump colludes with foreign governments; anything is fair game as long as they 'own the libs' - they‚Äôve rejected Democracy altogether.
