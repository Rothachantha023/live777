He knows how to fix the economy, provide jobs, make peace with North Korea &amp; secure the borders. And he makes a few typos in his tweets...Where he communicates directly with us like a normal human being. That's why he's President &amp; you're nobody.

Trump is all puffed up with the big 'I AM', but he's just being played again to show him up as a chump. If there's any perceived successful outcome, either the translators lied or Trump will lie after... if he MAKES it out of the meeting at ALL.

The reason they are not testing is b/c they have built up their arsenal. Yet, you want to believe that Kim will voluntarily give up those weapons.
