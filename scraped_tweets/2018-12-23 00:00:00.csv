Even Obama‚Äôs own intel heads admitted that no vote tallies were messed with. Stop putting out fake news that you get from fake news like CNN,MSNBC,ABC,CBS,NBC,and yes even Fox! Look into things yourself and stop relying on msm to give you honest news!

1076990246267600897 2018-12-23 18:57:38 -0400 <Judyki43> @realDonaldTrump 1/2 million people having a lousy Christmas directly because of you as you over indulge with your selfish family.  Millions losing money because of you lousy decisons.  Worst economy since the Great Depression.

1076990235484045312 2018-12-23 18:57:36 -0400 <Marc_Ullman> Looks like @realDonaldTrump declared #WarOnChristmas
1076990234846466049 2018-12-23 18:57:36 -0400 <GovMikeHuckabee> Suggestion for @realDonaldTrump to end impasse w/ Chuckie and Nancy over wall: Tell Nancy that she won't get Air Force planes to/from home like last time she was Speaker until we get full funding for wall.  Deal should be made in about 15 minutes.

1076990230589259776 2018-12-23 18:57:35 -0400 <MattieDougherty> @realDonaldTrump what are you doing about American Citizens responsible for gangs, drugs, sex trafficking, murder? $5 Billion could go a long way to fight crime ALREADY in our country committed by AMERICAN Citizens! Oh wait! Homeland Security has been furloughed? NOTHING A wall won't fix it

1076990222339067905 2018-12-23 18:57:33 -0400 <liberalgirl3> @realDonaldTrump Only you could find it appropriate to insult a senator 2 days before Christmas when you shut down the gov. over wall that nobody wants. I hope Christmas sucks for you. You are small, petty and mean. If there was a Santa he wld dump  a whole bankrupted coal mine in your front yard
1076990222175535110 2018-12-23 18:57:33 -0400 <Johnaglover91> @SenBobCorker Actually Mexico is paying for the wall through the new deal USMCA. Just dont hop on the bandwagon MR. CORK you all know we need the wall! It's either give us the wall or the government will stay shutdown, Trump sticks to what he says. @realDonaldTrump
