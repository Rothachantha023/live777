Itd safe to say,  he is taking on the persona of a spoiled rich little boy who puts when he doesnt get his way so hes learned the fine art of manipulation &amp; deception.

1112142087607193600 2019-03-30 19:58:30 -0400 <cynicinchicago> @realDonaldTrump It’s unfortunate that the GOP is more interested in racism over policy.  If they really cared about crime, they would strengthen gun laws.  If they really cared about immigration reform, they’d have done it when they had total control of all 3 branches of government. #worstPOTUS

That is not illegal. They did not sneak or break in. A majority of illegal people in the USA came in legally with visas, but overstayed them. Enforcing existing laws at the employer level fixes this
