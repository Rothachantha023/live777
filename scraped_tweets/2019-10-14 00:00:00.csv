Must have been like re-living high school all over again!  btw You folks are doing a great job. The GOPs are pulling their hair out. They have NO CONTROL over ANY of it! Even the witnesses they try to block are coming forward. Perhaps they need to take a hint!
1183894742695694337 2019-10-14 19:57:57 -0400 <lesammontgomery> @realDonaldTrump You are an angry &amp; narcissistic man. You know your supporters are all about only taking care of things ‚Äúclose to home‚Äù b/v they‚Äôre ignorant to national security, international safety, the downward spiral of relationships w/allies &amp; your lies. You WILL go down.
