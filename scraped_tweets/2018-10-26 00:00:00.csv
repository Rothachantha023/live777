1055972339932786689 2018-10-26 19:59:59 -0400 <thinkingvoice_m> @realDonaldTrump Something funnier than that is how you criticize the media and the Democrats, blaming them for the anger that might have led to the sending of bombs. You make worse comparisons like Dems will turn the country into Venezuela. You know you are lying and NOT presidential. Whine not.

How would you know how well Republicans are doing in early voting? The votes have not been counted yet.  2. The media would be remiss for not covering the attempted assassination of 14 people. This “Bomb” stuff is real news.

The new tactic is for Trump to call us a “mob”. Playing into any of that would be what he wants. If I could really speak my mind, 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
1055971890588598272 2018-10-26 19:58:12 -0400 <okyoudoknowJack> @JackPosobiec Islam doesn't radicalize people, individuals do.  You can support Islam and not support the individuals that misinterpret it. @realDonaldTrump directly radicalizes people through his words and actions.  You cannot support him and his power with the same absolution.

1055971847135735809 2018-10-26 19:58:02 -0400 <DanKellyHope> @realDonaldTrump Short history lesson: The term “watchdog” has long applied to the press, as in the phrase “watchdog of democracy.” Also “the Fourth Estate,” a term older than the US but meaning “fourth branch” of the government. Both are old, traditional metaphors. Sic ‘em!

1055971820564824064 2018-10-26 19:57:55 -0400 <STIXnTWIGS220> @realDonaldTrump Very profound statement to "any American, at all." The audience was American. ✔VoteRED✔if you're an American, too.

1055971815552675840 2018-10-26 19:57:54 -0400 <bk9net> @realDonaldTrump Charlie Kirk runs Turning Point USA, a racist, anti-LGBTQ, hateful organization. It's no wonder you like him, Don!
1055971812637474816 2018-10-26 19:57:53 -0400 <PAULUSV3> @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump I follow Trump because I want to read the nonsense he tweets first hand. Apart from that I detest the guy and his self serving "policies" so you might call me a FAKE FOLLOWER. Plenty of people do that, which means that the number of his TRUE FOLLOWERS is even smaller (I hope).

1055971775983611905 2018-10-26 19:57:45 -0400 <kregger2012> MSM needs to drop the soft labels and call it like it is.

1055971716323659776 2018-10-26 19:57:30 -0400 <kaysey17> No, once again @realDonaldTrump is lying.  He and @GOP are directly to blame for the bombings. Full stop.  #AbolishtheGOP #VoteOutTheGOP #LockUpTrump
1055971715073871872 2018-10-26 19:57:30 -0400 <longleafhill> @Char74able @realDonaldTrump I'm sorry, but your conspiracy theories are just full of too many holes. They don't make any logical sense. Doesn't add up. They can be discredited rather easily. I can explain in detail if you wish.
1055971714499149824 2018-10-26 19:57:30 -0400 <CADChick> @realDonaldTrump Are you thinking of ordering a false flag that targets Republicans?  Maybe you can get CNN to love you then.
1055971713991622656 2018-10-26 19:57:30 -0400 <jpostman> @realDonaldTrump Technically it's a dirigible.
1055971713509277696 2018-10-26 19:57:30 -0400 <tina_thinks> @realDonaldTrump Well, it may not be presidential when they criticize you either, but in case you hadn't noticed, they're not the president.

1055971712960004098 2018-10-26 19:57:30 -0400 <DavidG02986909> @realDonaldTrump The media is angry that you use Twitter instead of going through them to filter.  They use to control presidents that way but can't any longer.  JFK said the media was task to report the truth.  The media has failed JFK.
1055971712326647808 2018-10-26 19:57:29 -0400 <saralynne65> @kylegriffin1 Nobody wants you to call them @realDonaldTrump!! Not even Melanie or whatever the hell her name is 🙄🙄🙄 Girl, Pullleezz.

1055971706559447043 2018-10-26 19:57:28 -0400 <JohnMTweet> @realDonaldTrump “if you refuse to give up,” and “if you never quit,” are the same thing. It’s so hard to believe  you wrote anything yourself in college. Are you hoping this lame statement will be quoted by future Nazi youth? It first must be checked for plagiarism.
1055971706433617920 2018-10-26 19:57:28 -0400 <truckle4evr> @realDonaldTrump Hallmark cards is gonna sue you for plagiarism.

1055971699357736961 2018-10-26 19:57:26 -0400 <JeffMoore1126> @nypost @realDonaldTrump I'm surprised he would say that. This crackpot was doing this in your name.  I thought you would be flattered.
1055971698846191619 2018-10-26 19:57:26 -0400 <opositorisima> Ya saldrán los medios de comunicación internacional  a decir que @realDonaldTrump está provocando una guerra con los indefensos dirigidos por comunistas en la caravana para invadir a USA,ya veran al @CNN en primeros titulares
