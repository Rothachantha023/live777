1083151259220226048 2019-01-09 18:59:18 -0400 <GregHathorn> @realDonaldTrump It's harder to be a Republican. Why? Because it is hard for the lower &amp; middle class to see a world for themselves that is beyond the Democrat's social program handouts. They aren't told that these bribes for votes only serve to ensure they remain impoverished.

As for your assertion of a majority it is pretty close, most polls show it is about 52-48 so about along partisan lines.

1083151076335980545 2019-01-09 18:58:35 -0400 <CCtranslate> @realDonaldTrump  A virtual wall is the best one, anyone passing is tracked, etc. and a lot less money.
1083151076231004160 2019-01-09 18:58:35 -0400 <PatriotPen76> @realDonaldTrump Correct response, sir. A negotiation requires TWO parties willing to come to mutually satisfactory agreement. The Democratic Socialists do not want to negotiate, but dictate.  This is nothing more than the first volley of the 2020 election cycle, attempting to slander &amp; libel you

1083151061114867713 2019-01-09 18:58:31 -0400 <therealmarilee> @realDonaldTrump The people of Texas and New Mexico will fight you over eminent domain. You are going to take family farms and ranches owned by Americans to stop a crisis that only exists in your head. They will fight you till you are gone in 2020.

Trump torched the bill as a "giant amnesty" for narrowing the scope of deportations, and complained that it didn‚Äôt end diversity visas or stop "chain migration"...

Furthermore, I firmly believe @realDonaldTrump should not hold the gov‚Äôt hostage in an effort to achieve a political punchline.

1083151055427461125 2019-01-09 18:58:30 -0400 <raidnat> @GaetaSusan @realDonaldTrump I wonder if celebrities and other wealthy Dems agree with Cortez-Kennedy because she wants to raise taxes on them 60 to 70 % and truth be known most of the super rich in this country are Dems. Has anybody asked Pelosi and Schumer how they feel about this. they don't talk to me

1083151049890897920 2019-01-09 18:58:28 -0400 <johnnyxyz96> @realDonaldTrump Chuck and Nancy have been in government for over 50 years and what have they done to fix boarder security. For years our country has suffered with the boarder crisis , they have voted for walls in the past and as usually Mr President it finally takes you to take care of the mess.

Hillary Rodham Clinton? They have all been in Washington over 50years, with the exception of Hillary. In 50 years you would think that they have gotten a lot accomplished for the AMERICAN PEOPLE  right?
