The reason you're not in the negotiations is because you wouldn't understand what's being negotiated.    Stay out of it, like you always do and eat your Big Mac.

954140846840057856 2018-01-18 18:57:59 -0400 <Sapph1reSeas> @MannarinoJoey @realDonaldTrump Rs own the House, Congress and the WH. In theory, Rs are very capable of getting job done alone. Only reason they can’t is because not all Rs are onboard. Hence, to reach the # of votes needed, they need Dem votes. If not successful, blame Rs!
