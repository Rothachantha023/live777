1099820549113593858 2019-02-24 18:57:07 -0400 <wolfehunter01> @TimMurtaugh @PlaysTrumpCard @realDonaldTrump Careful Tim ,by joining Trump re election team Mueller will have you on the hot seat in no time at all , for some Mueller team thought up BULLSHIT!
1099820548752760837 2019-02-24 18:57:07 -0400 <mary_kabala> @realDonaldTrump Oh, as I was reading this, I thought Obama was going to give the address.üòÉ  Then I read the last word. üòû  Maybe you can bribe the military into giving you your military parade, too! And, good thing for your "HOLD THE DATE!".  I hope your 4th doesn't conflict with the nation's.

1099820542935220224 2019-02-24 18:57:05 -0400 <AnnieGabstonH> @BarackObama  Mr. President, I'm so excited.  @realDonaldTrump just said I should "hold the date" for a celebration on the 4th of July where my favorite president will speak.  I'm really looking forward to hearing you address the nation!
1099820538325880833 2019-02-24 18:57:04 -0400 <laughbeforeucry> @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump And yet no one in her inner circle has gone to jail.
1099820535066841089 2019-02-24 18:57:03 -0400 <AlCapwn2> @realDonaldTrump It will still be smaller than Obama‚Äôs inauguration.  I just feel it important to remind you of that because nothing makes me happier than your sublime sadness.

1099820531061325825 2019-02-24 18:57:02 -0400 <RSox102175> @realDonaldTrump I've seen this episode a hundred times. Can someone please change the channel?
1099820530327261185 2019-02-24 18:57:02 -0400 <DavidKo11488323> @realDonaldTrump I had no idea but there were jobs for people like Brian and Ed krassenstein, I would have never guessed the two inbred Brothers could make money by stalking the president and spewing a bunch of Lies after ripping off the elderly.
1099820529559707648 2019-02-24 18:57:02 -0400 <shanandcrew> @aarrrgggghhhhh3 @Rosie @CNN @realDonaldTrump In fact, there‚Äôs been some leaks bc @RepAdamSchiff is already threatening a subpoena if full report is not made public. Critical thinking skills would say after Barr met with Mueller then it comes out he‚Äôs got nothing...leaks happened. Schiff is the biggest leaker of all.
1099820528859312130 2019-02-24 18:57:02 -0400 <Technocorp> @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump I say thank God for Trump.  Next it should be outsourced services.  The US leads the world.  Every country will do the same.  Citizens will be able to live in their high cost of living zones.  They also have to fund their retirement to stay in their homes.

1099820518616780801 2019-02-24 18:56:59 -0400 <bogardus_mary> @realDonaldTrump - let‚Äôs not waste taxpayer dollars. Perhaps the money could be spent elsewhere? Say education? That‚Äôs what someone would do if they were struggling to balance their home budget. Let‚Äôs lower our debt?

1099820515005526017 2019-02-24 18:56:59 -0400 <MarisaWard57> @realDonaldTrump Wow, you're having Obama emcee the celebration?! Fantastic! He's my favorite president ever!
1099820514984579072 2019-02-24 18:56:59 -0400 <MaddiMatilda> @realDonaldTrump Unbelievable how big a fool you are.  We will all have to pay for your foolishness.
