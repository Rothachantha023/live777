Trump refused phone call with El Paso congresswoman ‚Äî despite having nothing on his schedule. The community has sent communication to Trump asking that he not come, stating he has said enough.

Loaning a firearm to someone you know is prohibited unless you are at a range, it's "Reasonably necessary" for hunting, or you are there.   Here's the problem, take farms as an example. If a farm hand needed a gun to use for pest control, the farmer would need to go to a gun..
1158889982548856833 2019-08-06 19:57:57 -0400 <MarcellaStovik> @thehill @VP needs to lecture @realDonaldTrump fueling the fire of US hate and anger about "taking a knee".  Perhaps twitter or google can refresh @VP memory if he has forgotten the vile comments from our president!!!
