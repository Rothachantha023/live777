You're smart &amp; know Whittaker has given @realDonaldTrump  all Mueller investigation info. Trump will black out most of it. Public will never see it.

Do we not believe that people can make mistakes learn from them and evolve? Why do we judge his character on one singular very poor choice of judgement and not on the entire volume of his life's work?

Now, on a global scale that‚Äôs not that long, but eventually we will start to cool from snow &amp; precip. Then repeat.

A few days earlier, nearby, almost 400 turned themselves in who went UNDER the WALL.  A wall only slows them down so border agents can find them. A SMART WALL identifies them sooner and then tracks them.

There‚Äôs a reason why the GOP won‚Äôt make this happen. It‚Äôs not about make it easier to vote. Republicans can‚Äôt win without purging voter rolls, disenfranchising, and making it harder for Dems to vote.
