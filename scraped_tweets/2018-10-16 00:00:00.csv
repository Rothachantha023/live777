1052347833771163648 2018-10-16 19:57:29 -0400 <NovAlphaNov> @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Instead of asking the USgovernment to help the citizens of another nation, why not ask the Honduran governement to improve the condition of its citizens?   I can guarantee you that Juan Orlando Hernandez doesn't have any empathy or compassion. Why don't you call him out instead?
