1142944194597654530 2019-06-23 19:55:05 -0400 <lostDev> @Slate This seems accurate. To @realDonaldTrump, why would these women come forward to tell the truth if they weren’t paid? Why subject themselves to public ridicule? Why choose to be analyzed by @SebGorka &amp; @IngrahamAngle? 45’s casual relationship w/truth assumes there must be a payoff

1142944162435796992 2019-06-23 19:54:57 -0400 <saoakman> @realDonaldTrump We also taxed the RICH at a 75% marginal rate to pay for that stuff. Other countries aren't paying for those tariffs--US consumers are--because you have the economic understanding of a 4 year old. (Apologies to 4 year olds who actually have an understanding of such things.)
