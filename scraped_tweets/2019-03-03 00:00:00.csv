That‚Äôs what having a sovereign country with borders means.

1102357071964631040 2019-03-03 18:56:21 -0400 <RaW_Gaming> @realDonaldTrump Stopping military drills actually reduces the readiness &amp; power of the armed forces. These regular drills are essential. Also, while the US has stopped these drills, N.Korea continues to produce more and more missiles and warheads... How is that a good thing??
