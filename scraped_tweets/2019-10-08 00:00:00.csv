1181720435009998851 2019-10-08 19:58:01 -0400 <mjean2> @realDonaldTrump PR's gov employees contributed &gt;30 yrs 2 receive a Pension when old. They R very low, since most earned +/- $1000/m! This fund was invested negligently by a Gov selected broker &amp; got high commission, but $$ was lost!.Now Gov cuts pensions 2 pay 4 default.NOT FAIR

They only focus on the EXACT things I'd want someone to say to take the blame off MY corruption, almost as if scripted! But no,. no one has the kind of money &amp;/or power that would provide incentives for a few people to  stage &amp; "capture" a conversation, or IS there?
