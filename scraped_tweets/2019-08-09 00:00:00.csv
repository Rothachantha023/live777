1159977535985336320 2019-08-09 19:59:30 -0400 <LFTGLF4> @realDonaldTrump Racism was never meant to be used as a political tool. It was intended to draw attention to "real" discrimination. But since 2008 Obama and the Democrat party has written a whole new book on the uses of "racism". #1 is liberals CAN NOT be racist.

If everyone were armed, there would be no mass shootings. Everyone would be afraid to try, or quickly stopped. You want more gun laws simply because you do not want to arm yourself.

The House has taken some definite steps towards common sense gun laws. The @SenateGOP a.k.a. @senatemajldr kills them. If the Senate didn't kill them, @realDonaldTrump would.

1159976904197365760 2019-08-09 19:56:59 -0400 <JSeulement2019> Good question. Is it "did you vote Trump/GOP so you could buy this gun?" or is it "do you have a history of domestic violence or violent mental health ideologies?" One guess which one #MoscowMitch and @realDonaldTrump will consider thorough and meaningful.
