You mentioned that you talked to so many people last eeek about China‚Äôs issue. They agreed to become tougher. Whom you met? All trump‚Äôs supporters? If my monthly household cost goes up, who will pay me? Trump? Who went to China in 1974?

982044298626654208 2018-04-05 19:56:20 -0400 <truthsnews> @realDonaldTrump Your jeolousy of the brilliant Jeff Bezo is embarrassing.  You are not as young, not as accomplished, not as bright, and definitely not as rich.  So much to be jeolous of.

Doesn't @realDonaldTrump know it's more presidential to invite all of Hollywood for $$$ multi million tax dollar star studded self bloviating birthday parties in the white house.... has he no shame!!
982044295199944704 2018-04-05 19:56:20 -0400 <BluePixie3> @realDonaldTrump All the #GOPTaxScam did was increase our debt! Those one time bonuses, many of which were already planned, were a cheap publicity stunt that doesn‚Äôt really help the American worker. &amp; a majority of workers have not seen any increase. The ones benefiting are corporations &amp; top 1%.

982044289927495681 2018-04-05 19:56:18 -0400 <kiz_white> @vicsepulveda @realDonaldTrump This is at the heart of my discomfort of his presidency.  He can't seem to get a handle on checks and balances. Spouting inaccuracies and enraging economies here and abroad.  All the while he/cabinit are spending hand-over-fist. I seriously wonder if we can survive him.
