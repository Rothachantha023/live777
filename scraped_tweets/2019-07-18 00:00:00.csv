1152005027164119040 2019-07-18 19:59:36 -0400 <kathyatk6746> And @realDonaldTrump brags at what he got away with on average 15 year old pageant girls. And he’s not involved with Epstein? His Southern white house just became what it is, just more trash associated w/ tRump. Confiscate it for Tax Evasion &amp; make it a migrant shelter. Karma! 😊

He created the problem!  Yes, the choice will be a no-brainer in 2020, don't vote for the dope with no brain at all!  Democrats will fix it again

No records other than the immigration request, and filing jointly in taxes. I think anyone would be afraid of islamaphobia attached to them. A lot of good reading is out there.

He is not afraid to stand up for Ilhan Omar's rights despite her verbal attacks on America and Israel. Trump is the bigger man. In addition, he defended Pelosi against the racist attacks from of the squad. Not a racist bone in his body.

Where real men, true Patriots went to battle, thousands laying down their lives so that years later, a little rich boy from Queens had the freedom to sit back, spanking his ‘bone spur’ while others like Robert Mueller went off to Vietnam.

You would give satan himself a run for his money. God hears the cries of those caged children. You will answer to him. There a special hell for people like you.

Trump made positive comments about Epstein in 2002. If there was a "falling-out," as Trump alleges, it took place after that. He says he threw Epstein out of a club due to improprieties w a young teen there.

To not stand up against those chants. You were born into privilege, remember that. You never earned it. But you know that deep down inside, dont you?

Trump has been trying to divide us since he stepped into office—and even before then, with the stupid birther claims. Glad you’re at least finally acknowledging what’s he’s doing. #DividerInChief
