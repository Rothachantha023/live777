Trump also made a direct threat about the cost NK would pay if they ever attempted a launch against the US or its allies, something no other president has done.
974795993647669250 2018-03-16 19:54:10 -0400 <4YearNightmare> I thought maybe, just maybe @realDonaldTrump would try to impersonate a human being and offer his condolences and maybe even a tribute to @louiseslaughter, despite their HUGE differences, but wrong so far. When will I learn? RIP Congresswoman Slaughter.  https://t.co/2PzmVQfsMj
