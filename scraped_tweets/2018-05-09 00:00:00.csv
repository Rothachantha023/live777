994366272518279169 2018-05-09 19:59:28 -0400 <antymich> @realDonaldTrump So let's see, North Korea takes American citizens hostage and then releases them in exchange for a face to face meeting with the president of the United States. Sounds like a win for Kim Jong-un, not @realDonaldTrump.

994366265673236480 2018-05-09 19:59:26 -0400 <MaceB720> @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump I wouldn't necessarily consider increasing our deficit and alienating our allies to be "winning." I'd think winning would be decreasing the deficit, insuring millions, saving the auto industry, killing Osama, and Wall Street reform... all done by President Obama.

So criticising him for not being around when the President is announcing his latest attempt to start a nuclear war, and no-one will say where he is, is pretty much normal.
