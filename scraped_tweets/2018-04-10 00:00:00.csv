The midterms will sweep out Republican control of the house and all their efforts wiped away. Then it's time to impeach Trump and Pence.

Oh wait, it will never happen because conservatives don‚Äôt make up fake dossiers about their political opponents and then demand unlimited special councils!

983856225828917249 2018-04-10 19:56:18 -0400 <TimCalandrino1> @realDonaldTrump Go ahead and fire Mueller and you will be obstructing Justice just like Nunes did in the House. The GOP is complicit with not doing a real investigation. Mueller has to be allowed to complete the work he is doing. We will take to the streets. #ProtectMueller

There's some unanswered questions and until the murderer is caught, it all sounds fishy. I'm not connecting any dots for a conspiracy theory either. A murderer needs to be found first.
