1109967866105921537 2019-03-24 19:58:56 -0400 <evanstarr> @KellyannePolls @POTUS @realDonaldTrump So you're going to ignore his money laundering and obstruction of justice? Mueller was NEVER going to indict the President, and he was pretty clear that obstruction of justice is very fair game. He was ALWAYS going to let the reader decide how to interpret.

I notice @realDonaldTrump is no longer saying the report should be released.  Till we see the orig report, and Mueller has answered a LOT of questions, the Barr report is just a fairytale.

The individuals doing this need inspected by the FBI  - something is going that is against our country.

Not indicted does not mean not guilty. Not enough evidence of collusion/conspiracy to win a case doesn't mean it didn't happen. Many sealed indictments exist.
