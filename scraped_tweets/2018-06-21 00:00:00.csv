Then people are no longer owned by rich landowners . And we can buy alcohol again. And "coloreds" can sit at the counter with everyone else. And everyone over 18 can vote. You know, stupid stuff like that...
1009948809881931777 2018-06-21 19:58:54 -0400 <thebigfade> @realDonaldTrump Narcissistic tendencies at work. To pull a self serving stunt like this as @FLOTUS really shows true colors about intent. Complicit and disgusting to intentionally distract from what should be a meaningful visit looking into the wellness and condition of children. Shameful family

Uglier than any wall, you are a grotesque and the biggest confession of insecurity, weakness and cowardice. Why would ANYONE want to come to "your country"?
