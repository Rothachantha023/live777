Can‚Äôt wait until GOP controls all three branches after next election. Reps like Cummings are getting what they deserve. He stole from his district. Karma!
1157440363365376000 2019-08-02 19:57:41 -0400 <ScienceIsNoMyth> Jesus was a Jewish Middle Eastern man. So. He was not a Anglo European white guy. Thus, @realDonaldTrump is actually being a racist to those who look like Jesus and anyone who does not look white.  How is not racist? He fought against the Jewish religion.
