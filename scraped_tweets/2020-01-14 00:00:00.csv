You know the place where #MoscowMitch is rigging the trial with and for you.  The one that you won't let any one testify at.

1217234638168522752 2020-01-14 18:58:47 -0400 <jp10E> @realDonaldTrump Because the House doesn‚Äôt conduct a trial. They handled the impeachment, which is similar to a criminal indictment. Also, the House wanted to speak to witnesses from your administration, but you prevented their testimony. Wouldn‚Äôt they confirm just how ‚Äúperfect‚Äù the call was?
