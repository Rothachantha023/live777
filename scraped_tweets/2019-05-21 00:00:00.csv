THIS is the question that they use to deny it? He slept on the fucking   couch, another room, on the floor, in the bathroom;Sick pervert--He slept on that bed to savor the act. YUP!

No need to make things worse with this guy.  There are things that are worse than what you might call the deep state. Trump, without a shadow of a doubt, is one of those things.

The report shows plenty of evidence of collusion, by definition. Thing is, collusion isn‚Äôt illegal &amp; Mueller's investigation focuses on criminal activity.

1130985778719395840 2019-05-21 19:56:37 -0400 <jberg59> @realDonaldTrump Mueller did not investigate collusion, he investigated whether there was an agreement by your campaign to enter into a criminal conspiracy with Russians. He found that there was not enough evidence to obtain a conviction; Don Jr‚Äôs idiocy saved him from being indicted for this.

1130985647810981888 2019-05-21 19:56:05 -0400 <ForChrist15> @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence And he'll lie, for you! Making America like Russia, only loyal to you! The blind of your lies! How is our economy, you opening all those oilfields. They can't get enough workers, little city's going up in NM. How do you get the market going flood it with oil, for the rich!

1130985633743278081 2019-05-21 19:56:02 -0400 <HostetterGmail> @seanhannity Of course they are. @realDonaldTrump better drop the hammer soon. This is getting outrageous!
1130985632346574850 2019-05-21 19:56:02 -0400 <PaulDoody78> @realDonaldTrump Ok more lies from Donnie, Mueller did not conclude anything on collusion or obstruction. In fact over 1000 reputable prosecutors say they would have won an obstruction case with his evidence, unlike Barr the hack. Plus you yourself chickened our from testifying, cant tell truth!
1130985629225852928 2019-05-21 19:56:01 -0400 <ellenruth206> @dad_darius @realDonaldTrump This is so funny but it is also really sad. The role of HUD is to provide housing and community development assistance and to make sure everyone has access to ‚Äúfair and equal‚Äù housing. Real people are being affected by his incompetence.

1130985619134582786 2019-05-21 19:55:58 -0400 <PamSimson> @Jim_Jordan Democrats must remove @realDonaldTrump before their crimes are exposed, their arrests begin and their lavish cocktail parties are interrupted
