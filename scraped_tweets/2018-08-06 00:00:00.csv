1026618634796298240 2018-08-06 19:58:50 -0400 <ajc1305> @realDonaldTrump Absolute nonsense.  As usual, when something is happening that draws attention to your immorality (lies, adultery, racism, misogeny)  you try to divert attention to something else. Trees hold down soil, stop landslides, moderate climate..But hey, that's science..too hard.

Regardless if you're the president or not you have consequences that you have to pay and so does your kids
1026618096264650752 2018-08-06 19:56:42 -0400 <BertaMassaro> @JayandChrissy2 @realDonaldTrump Oh, they probably haven't said anything about this on fox, and he doesn't read, even our tweets. Those around him try to keep him mollified, and I doubt if they would want to be the ones to break this to him.

Stop destroying the environment just because YOU won‚Äôt be around that much longer doesn‚Äôt mean you can destroy it. I highly suggest the book Wump World I think it‚Äôs about on your level!
