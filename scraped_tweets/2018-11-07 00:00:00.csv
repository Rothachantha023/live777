1060320915366408192 2018-11-07 18:59:40 -0400 <SloGrace> @realDonaldTrump What do you call sending troops to the border for a caravan that is thousands of miles away and not a threat to our country? A total waste of money! Nice try.

Instead, @realDonaldTrump wants too act like he's still on a reality show grabbing headlines for the spotlight.

1060320834101886976 2018-11-07 18:59:21 -0400 <jeffpayne1108> @IrishHalfPint67 @realDonaldTrump We took the house.  With no voter fraud, no matter what YOUR presidential fraud tells you.
1060320834043174913 2018-11-07 18:59:21 -0400 <Rsionne9> Of course @realDonaldTrump derided the hard work of GOP reps who lost seats last night; he hates work. He thinks hard work is for suckers and people who believe in working hard are rubes.
1060320833313288192 2018-11-07 18:59:21 -0400 <fitcoachT> @terracotta05 @lgontaweddings @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @Acosta @CNN @SecretService This would have been avoided had president been answering questions instead of avoiding them. Don’t have a press conference if you don’t plan on answering all questions. Just go back to tweeting 🤷🏻‍♀️🙄

1060320830826168321 2018-11-07 18:59:20 -0400 <dibythesea1> @realDonaldTrump So the secretary to Jeff Sessions is now Attorney General.  Great, great, great...

1060320829911846913 2018-11-07 18:59:20 -0400 <HardleyKurt> @Acosta you should be ashamed. Your behavior is much worse then @realDonaldTrump. You are a guest. @CNN needs to pull you out of the White House.  #stopgrandstanding

All Trump is doing, is making sure he gets his own money now. What happens later isn't his problem.Cutting your ties of of the world financially ruins your national economy in the long run

As individuals, we have a right not to be targeted for harassment, which happens daily.

1060320794314596352 2018-11-07 18:59:11 -0400 <LarryPeckham> @realDonaldTrump You should ban Jim Acosta for the next so many press conferences due to his disrespect for the office of the presidency and the press conference process. And tell them all that this forum is not a debate for their views. And only one question per reporter.

1060320643512700928 2018-11-07 18:58:35 -0400 <FlyLikeArcher> According to @realDonaldTrump, it is racist to ask questions about nationalism but it’s perfectly okay to refer to Hispanics as house keepers and rapists, Arabs as terrorists, and African-Americans as the n-word. He must also think Hitler was a hero.

1060320548427849729 2018-11-07 18:58:13 -0400 <DToddH> @CNNPR @realDonaldTrump @Acosta shouldn’t have hit her arm. It’s disgusting and shows the lowest level of respect for women.
1060320546532089857 2018-11-07 18:58:12 -0400 <DeniseMasterson> @DrDenaGrayson @realDonaldTrump imagine here we go again,
1060320543688278016 2018-11-07 18:58:12 -0400 <alexabme> @realDonaldTrump Hey Donny you might want to read the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998.  Means your boy Matty can’t oversee the mueller investigation.
1060320542807461888 2018-11-07 18:58:11 -0400 <jayenomics> @realDonaldTrump Richard Nixon tried this shit too....see how that worked out for him?
1060320542421590016 2018-11-07 18:58:11 -0400 <joyce4245> @realDonaldTrump Again, you have confused dictator with president. Your enormous ego can not stand any one who questiones your ability to be president.  You have no ability.  You have no tact. You are an embarrasment. Have you ever even read our constitution? Can you read?
1060320541691797505 2018-11-07 18:58:11 -0400 <shanlonwu> #Trump firing #JeffSessions completely expected and so revealing about @realDonaldTrump reaction to losses last night.  He needed to feel like the boss today real bad.  #FBRParty

Make no mistake, the Dem majority House will never allow that. You’re a crook and a traitor who will be stopped!!
1060320537535115264 2018-11-07 18:58:10 -0400 <IndustrieWind> @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Congrats Nancy 😂 good luck fighting the traitor

You will be called upon to answer for the mischief that you and tRump have colluded on over the past two years and before.

1060320533718417408 2018-11-07 18:58:09 -0400 <BungieAlex> @steveelrod1 @realDonaldTrump Did you always think the news was fake or only when Trump said they were. Only reason why he saids it is cod he’s the target  you’re brain washed by a man who uses his charity funds to cover his own expenses and raises funds for a Trump university that never happened.
1060320531088596992 2018-11-07 18:58:09 -0400 <KaryAnthony2> @arau75 @realDonaldTrump I agree the employers are to blame therefore everify has to be made mandatory for all employers which takes Dems to get on board with, which they haven’t and won’t.

With Sesions's firing, Mueller must now act very quickly.

1060320512449110016 2018-11-07 18:58:04 -0400 <cwcherryiv> @realDonaldTrump please just answer fake news questions with “yes”, “no” or “maybe”. That will drive them insane.

1060320504144371712 2018-11-07 18:58:02 -0400 <KeithKail> @CNNPR @realDonaldTrump How about train your journalists to do their job rather than use that position as an agenda driven platform for the left. Then you might get the respect a good news shop should get.
1060320504026931200 2018-11-07 18:58:02 -0400 <IdiotOfTheWeek1> @realDonaldTrump For all the times you talk down to women, for all the times grabbed women,  for all the times you assaulted women, for all the times you cheated on women, for all the times you disrespected women.....  .....women in the house are going to take you down. #DemsTakeTheHouse
