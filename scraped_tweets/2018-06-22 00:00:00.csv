1010311470716997632 2018-06-22 19:59:59 -0400 <greywolfmoon3> @realDonaldTrump UR lumping together illegal migrants who killed people, w/ little kids &amp; their parents looking 4 a better life? Then U told one of these parents today that their deceased family member looks like Tom Selleck? Then U signed photos of all their deceased? You R one sick, sick "man"!

He recognizes more than anyone that there is a welcome place in America for the contributions of so many who don't have the choices the rest of us have.

1010311137387110400 2018-06-22 19:58:40 -0400 <SpiritWolf97011> @realDonaldTrump You are making inaccurate statements because YOU don't want to work with Democrats.  YOU don't want to support citizens that aren't Republicans.  So you constantly lie to your base.  You put people who lost loved ones from immigrants through turmoil again.
1010311137290682370 2018-06-22 19:58:40 -0400 <mickau88> @realDonaldTrump How many children killed by guns? You need a bigger stage.

1010311135659081728 2018-06-22 19:58:40 -0400 <BCISLEMAN> @Carol4OliveFarm @donwinslow @realDonaldTrump It puts EXACTLY the right perspective on this horror. US policy has been terrible for years. Why should we imprison--especially children--for misdemeanor of illegal entry? Trump takes it to another level by pandering to his nativist base, demonizing Latinos, &amp; brutalizing them.

God save us, let’s hope there are enough clear headed people when the voting begins.  The language used  about the POTUS &amp; his wife are despicable.  I am sure their Mothers are so proud of them.

Ridiculous.

People in Mexico would cross the border to work in the US &amp; then cross back at night to go home. The super militarization forces more people to relocate here for work.

1010310897745715202 2018-06-22 19:57:43 -0400 <pkmetak> I've never heard @maddow show any outrage over American Children being murdered by illegals but she was outraged that @realdonaldtrump didn't hand over his Tax Returns.  You should examine the soul and character of every source.
