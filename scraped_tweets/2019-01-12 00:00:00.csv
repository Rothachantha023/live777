Let‚Äôs see vote for you and get a person who only fights for non Americans or for the Don who only fights for real Americans! You don‚Äôt have a chance in hell! I still want to see you be defeated though! That will be so funny!

Unless Clinton and trump both helped break the law to get it.just receiving stolen info itself isn‚Äôt a crime,or half of journalists today would be guilty of same.
