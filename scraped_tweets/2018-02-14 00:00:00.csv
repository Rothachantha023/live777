963925823869849600 2018-02-14 18:59:59 -0400 <realsamkelley> @realDonaldTrump You envoke violence, so I'm surprised you even acknowledged a shooter or shooting. I'm sure he voted for you, so once again feel really really proud of your supporters Sir. Really really good guy, but make sure due process first. Innocent untill proven guilty, so he can vote .
963925823857266689 2018-02-14 18:59:59 -0400 <Tsak_All_Stars> @Mackinz78 @realDonaldTrump Yeah, keep doing nothing and keep watching America’s kids die every week. Australia seemed to take care of this issue. You don’t see this anywhere else in the volume you do here.  It comes down to mental health and guns need to be addressed, no easy answers. But change is needed.

His kids were pawns to give the illusion he's a devoted father/family man when clearly he isn't. First wife, Ivana, said it herself, she raised the kids alone.
963925821978267649 2018-02-14 18:59:59 -0400 <nelaknight2> @Amy_Siskind @realDonaldTrump Thr is going to be a mass shooting beyond belief. More ppl killed than one can imagine. Thats my prediction.
963925819407196160 2018-02-14 18:59:58 -0400 <FranklinCole43> @DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump Give me a break. Maybe it's on Obama's head after all after Sandy Hook I thought Obama was going to Institute more gun control.

963925814927659008 2018-02-14 18:59:57 -0400 <DotardHunter> @realDonaldTrump thanks.  Those prayers certainly worked well last time.  Only 18 school shootings this year too, that's probably not going to be a record #OrangeDementia

This is not fake news, this is reality. 18 school shootings in a month and a half of 2018. Come on....are these statistics helping to make America great again?

963925807801434112 2018-02-14 18:59:56 -0400 <gainer_harold> @realDonaldTrump You and the GOP have no respect  for human life. Whether it’s a quick death from gun fire to a slow painful death due to a lack of healthcare. This is what happens when our government views it’s people as a potential work force not as human beings. Your God is money.

963925798343372800 2018-02-14 18:59:53 -0400 <gabrielobrien> @realDonaldTrump None of these school shooting deaths would have been prevented by a wall. Gun control, yes. Wall no.

They have some of the strictest gun legislation in the world, didn't stop anything. When an armed subject is killing folks, they are only stopped by either themselves or somebody shooting back.
963925780794363909 2018-02-14 18:59:49 -0400 <Stillcrazysteve> @realDonaldTrump So think carefully – what might improve the situation? Just keep tweeting every minute or so, and eventually even you might come up with the right answer!

Your country is a global joke with Agent Orange as the ring master. Stop with the thoughts and prayers. Elect someone who will get rid of the guns.

963925627526111232 2018-02-14 18:59:13 -0400 <ProudSnowflake5> You can bet @realDonaldTrump is happy the news isn’t focused on him for the moment. That’s ok Donnie, Mueller is and we will get back to your porn star payout &amp; your protecting wife abusers after we pay respect to the children who died today because the #NRA bought &amp; paid for you
963925627312201728 2018-02-14 18:59:13 -0400 <MuchasPersonaz> @realDonaldTrump It is not too soon to start talking about gun control.
963925626779590657 2018-02-14 18:59:12 -0400 <judyjuice79> @realDonaldTrump Your prayers are NOT working! 19 shootings at schools, killing children,  in 44 days of 2018!! Twitler, we have a problem here! Guns are too accessible, they can shoot too many bullets too fast &amp; it needs to stop now!
963925626645372928 2018-02-14 18:59:12 -0400 <jennymurphy1919> @realDonaldTrump Finally something we agree on.  It’s too bad you won’t do a damned thing about it.

963925618822926338 2018-02-14 18:59:11 -0400 <nattyice_13> @realDonaldTrump Fuck your prayers. Excuse my language, but so long as the Republican Party remains the NRA’s little monkeys, your prayers mean nothing. Their blood is on your hands.

963925617824673793 2018-02-14 18:59:10 -0400 <CaioSpeaks> @realDonaldTrump Frankly my dear, I don’t give a damn about your condolences. What are you doing about it?
963925616079798273 2018-02-14 18:59:10 -0400 <BrentinCT> @realDonaldTrump After the Las Vegas mass shooting, you did nothing (besides LIE to get your #TAXSCAM passed). After numerous school shootings in 2018, you DID NOTHING! The deaths today are due PRIMARILY TO YOUR #NEGLIGENCE !!!! #RESIGN45andVP #NRAsponsoredTERRORISM
963925614804705281 2018-02-14 18:59:10 -0400 <insoMOMniac> 45 days into 2018 and already 7 school shootings. 20 killed, dozens injured.   This cannot be tolerated anymore. When will our government pick the safety of our children over money from the NRA?  @realDonaldTrump enough with your prayers. The time for gun control is now.
963925614704185350 2018-02-14 18:59:10 -0400 <evan_meltzer> @realDonaldTrump Stop the Violence!!!!  We need better gun laws Not more guns. What is wrong with you? Grow a set.
963925613672321029 2018-02-14 18:59:09 -0400 <worldforchange2> @realDonaldTrump Stop it now! Sanction the hell of it! Mental health and gun sanctions! Tonight! No more dying!

963925609511612416 2018-02-14 18:59:08 -0400 <ch3vyridinhigh> @realDonaldTrump why was the shooter taken to the hospital? Did he shoot hisself or something?🤷🏽‍♂️
963925609134006272 2018-02-14 18:59:08 -0400 <aluminumpatriot> @JLBurgoa @GaetaSusan @realDonaldTrump Schools have “Resource Officers” usually an officer close to retirement who doesn’t want to have to fill out paperwork and just run the D.A.R.E. Program...so they just wander the halls not looking for trouble...

963925607590584320 2018-02-14 18:59:08 -0400 <jackhalpin_art> @realDonaldTrump When you say it, it sounds empty.
963925607175221248 2018-02-14 18:59:08 -0400 <Lolasmommy516> @realDonaldTrump Interesting.  No child should feel unsafe.  What about all the trans kids your pal Devoss just closed the door on? Don’t they count?
963925606042714113 2018-02-14 18:59:08 -0400 <wonderwoman1246> @realDonaldTrump Another day in America.
963925605535404032 2018-02-14 18:59:07 -0400 <MBrancatoJr> @realDonaldTrump LIAR!! For people to matter to you they have to be rich, white and male. You regard everyone else with contempt and view us as disposable. EVERY @GOP MoC takes NRA money. The US has 4.4% of the world population and nearly HALF of the guns owned by citizens.
963925603362713601 2018-02-14 18:59:07 -0400 <LightworkPhoto> @sethmoulton @realDonaldTrump He already did everything he’s going to do.  You think the NRA president is actually going to treat 35,000 gun deaths a year as a problem?  Nice thought, though.
963925602272206848 2018-02-14 18:59:07 -0400 <newunivrse> @realDonaldTrump I hate you with every ounce of me

963925600858763264 2018-02-14 18:59:06 -0400 <SpenAlex> @NBCNews Hey America. @realDonaldTrump How about putting that money to starting some gun control legislation!!!! I’m sorry I digress - an average of 3 shootings per week in 2018 isn’t quite enough yet. My bad.
963925596341526528 2018-02-14 18:59:05 -0400 <nikonalltime> @realDonaldTrump Ask the senators that were on the baseball field how they felt the morning of their shooting and then ask them how they would have felt if they were between the ages of 10-18 as these children are. Something has to be done. Schools can’t be killing fields.

963925588149985280 2018-02-14 18:59:03 -0400 <StephanieJulian> @realDonaldTrump Then do something about it. Right now. Step the hell up and be the goddamn president and do something about this problem. Get a spine.
963925587843862528 2018-02-14 18:59:03 -0400 <Miranda_Ward> @realDonaldTrump The American Dream is now an American Nightmare. The poor poor families whose lives have been devastated by this event.  Poor poor America.  The real tragedy is the arrogance of thinking things do not need to change and that America is the best.
963925583439810560 2018-02-14 18:59:02 -0400 <Melopinionsonly> @DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump @NRA Thank you for this list. This should be re-tweeted and forwarded everyday. Every hour.
963925581724377088 2018-02-14 18:59:02 -0400 <wlfpack74> @realDonaldTrump What are “we” doing?  Looks like local law enforcement is doing their job. What are “we” doing to stop this insanity????
963925581560729601 2018-02-14 18:59:02 -0400 <Aimee_lizzie22> ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! @GOP  @realDonaldTrump  how many of these have to happen for you to open your eyes!  https://t.co/TsJAVGowqm

963925579006464000 2018-02-14 18:59:01 -0400 <timwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump But you and the rest of the @gop and @nra won’t do fuck-all about it. Meaningless words, as usual.
963925578754805760 2018-02-14 18:59:01 -0400 <TNGhen> @realDonaldTrump Then do something to prevent this from happening elsewhere. DO SOMETHING. Prayers offered for victims of gun violence don’t prevent it and are pretty much worthless sound bites.
963925578024923136 2018-02-14 18:59:01 -0400 <bcrws> Wake Up @realDonaldTrump  we need  #GunControlNow

It can’t without numerous approvals by agencies, just like the original sale of shares was approved by multiple agencies/ including State. This whole story is an example of very fake news. Read up
963925574178586624 2018-02-14 18:59:00 -0400 <spayer> @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump Lack of gun control is why the shooter had a gun.

What is sensible?  You can bet he did not get these legally or like Columbine he took them from home. How could ANY LAW prevent this NUT from doing this?  Maybe it;s time for #MORESCHOOLSECURITY

963925572375273473 2018-02-14 18:58:59 -0400 <garylerude> You run a tight ship @realDonaldTrump. Maybe y’all need to take an ethics class. “Veterans Affairs chief Shulkin, staff misled ethics officials about European trip, report finds”  https://t.co/PNJnhd6TSU  https://t.co/KackyEbBxd

963925569065889793 2018-02-14 18:58:59 -0400 <mlatt123> @realDonaldTrump this is the 29th mass shooting of 2018 &amp; it's only 45 days into year. 17 dead. NO MORE! Not 1 more death frm guns! When will you publicly say anything about guns? Still too early? Vegas shooting was months ago, yet so quiet about this issue which is non partisan.
963925568839475200 2018-02-14 18:58:59 -0400 <PeachFozz> @saraxpara And nothing will get accomplished with @realDonaldTrump in office.

963925561474240513 2018-02-14 18:58:57 -0400 <swetnaste> @realDonaldTrump How much did the NRA give you to not do shit about it?
963925561411223553 2018-02-14 18:58:57 -0400 <Cadfael18> @realDonaldTrump Not much point in being sorry for the shooting, Orange Boy. Innocent American kids have to bear the consequences of being gun mad and this idiot having access to them.

963925554432036864 2018-02-14 18:58:55 -0400 <JosephDVogel> @realDonaldTrump What are you going to do about it? Gun law changes NOW.
963925554373189632 2018-02-14 18:58:55 -0400 <Ilovenaps6> @realDonaldTrump Better legislation, a ban semi-automatic weapons perhaps. Us "Dems" don't want to take away all the guns. Hand guns and shot guns are fine but not semi-automatics. Please do something!
963925553932840962 2018-02-14 18:58:55 -0400 <GingerBeckGirl> @AngelaBelcamino @realDonaldTrump I’ve become so numb to these things. We as a country stopped caring on December 14, 2012, when we decided that we wouldn’t take action against future massacres of children.

963925448475512832 2018-02-14 18:58:30 -0400 <Towhead99> @realDonaldTrump Remember the feeling you felt just a couple of days ago when your daughter-in-law was assaulted with corn starch? Imagine how the moms and dads of those 17 dead kids in Florida are feeling tonight. You can do something but I'll bet that again you will do nothing.

Most of them know nothing of politics, but they all hate you with a passion.  You should have resigned with a huge public apology, but instead here you are...
963925369131761665 2018-02-14 18:58:11 -0400 <RichardGoodnou2> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump The Florida school shooting ought to mean enough is enough. I'm an advocate of having guns available for hunting and self protection. But nobody needs an Automatic rifle for either of these. A handgun for protection and a shotgun for hunting is enough.
963925368272048129 2018-02-14 18:58:11 -0400 <truthisstrength> @realDonaldTrump I guess the POTUS will be offering thoughts and prayers instead of real change

Nothing significant gets done. Actions can be taken to improve mental health, as well as school security. It’s a societal issue. These issues have only been around for about 20 years, despite guns being accessed for much longer.

963925351364734976 2018-02-14 18:58:07 -0400 <LimerickCeltic> @JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump Why do teachers need to conceal carry? Should the question not be why the fuck do students have automatic weapons at school or anywhere else for that matter. Teachers in other countries don't have weapons. Neither do students. Why is that??? Should that not be the question.
