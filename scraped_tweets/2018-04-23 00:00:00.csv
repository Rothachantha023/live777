Or that they'll be deported at any minute, if they do the smallest thing wrong under this administration...

988566900920733696 2018-04-23 19:54:50 -0400 <chbrkr> @kylegriffin1 Wait! How is Trump allowed to use his private phone to conduct gov‚Äôt. business? Isn‚Äôt that the same as Hillary using a private email server? Hasn‚Äôt @realDonaldTrump been attacking her daily for something he is doing? Also Ivanka and Jared used a private server until caught.
