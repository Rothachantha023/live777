972984362739183616 2018-03-11 19:55:23 -0400 <TruongDoanMD> @NatashaBertrand @jaketapper So @realDonaldTrump wants to stop ‚Äú60 minutes‚Äù from airing an interview with a porn star he‚Äôs never had an affair with?
972984360252203009 2018-03-11 19:55:23 -0400 <_NotFakeNews_> Trump will not issue restrictions on gun regulations or age reform. They stated that it should be up to the states. This all came after their meeting with the @NRA   @realDonaldTrump and the NRA are profiting off of the deaths of Americans. They‚Äôre the terrorists of this country.

The thing occupying it @realDonaldTrump keeps lowering the bar to the level of his own sick and desperate narcissism . Our democracy is being slowly driven over the cliff by a sociopath . At what point will the @GOP take action?

972984354736693252 2018-03-11 19:55:22 -0400 <Rebecca36346406> @kurtbardella @realDonaldTrump But it's ok to cover our elected officials picking illegal immigrants rights over our own citizens? American citizens should always come before illegals no matter what shouldn't even be up for discussion. End of story.

972984303557558272 2018-03-11 19:55:09 -0400 <NancySThompson> @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump That #Trump is everything #evangelicals &amp; the @GOP have spent decades preaching against yet now embrace because these #hypocrites are too weak &amp; morally corrupt to stand up for their supposed #FamilyValues in the face of losing political power.
