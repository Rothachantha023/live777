1078802002614865920 2018-12-28 18:56:55 -0400 <eclipticart> @realDonaldTrump For the best protection of the American people against the actual threat, this is the only #Wall that has to be built:  (best value if no communication can go through)  https://t.co/zP1lQv6XwS
1078802002551951365 2018-12-28 18:56:55 -0400 <NatDRichards> @ALT_uscis @realDonaldTrump Why why whyyyyy wasn‚Äôt I following you before. You are my people üíó
1078802002359058437 2018-12-28 18:56:55 -0400 <ToddJameson8> @Sportsmom10_5 @realDonaldTrump You do realize that there are US citizens on both sides of the border. Explain how US citizens, without any national security threat, can be stopped from entering or exiting the US. What laws, statutes, federal regulations allows the president to close it on a whim.  Facts count.
1078802001524338688 2018-12-28 18:56:54 -0400 <Squirrely007> This is what happens when people think things through @realDonaldTrump.  they see how stupid off the cuff promises really are. #NoWall

1078801993215266816 2018-12-28 18:56:53 -0400 <Gordonrossa> @zachabetew @WranglerDanger @goldengirl279 @realDonaldTrump Wake up.  Walls are only one part of an overall security plan.   Walls DO WORK.  Why do many homes and private estates have fences AND walls?  Machine guns work too.  It ultimately came down,  but the Berlin wall worked a lot better than existing protection at the Southern border
1078801992154140672 2018-12-28 18:56:52 -0400 <VivianeWoodcock> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo Is this a joke???

1078801982104788992 2018-12-28 18:56:50 -0400 <marie5483> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Except when he fails to donate money to veterans groups from his slush fund fake foundation or when he lies to them about pay raises or when he tells them they're suckers for fighting overseas or sends them to the border for a midterm election stunt right? Other than that....üôÅ
1078801982100516864 2018-12-28 18:56:50 -0400 <Stephen90521764> @jean_geeneegee @dropbear008 @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends He's not a professional politician, she never signed up for this when she married him. She's just trying to make the best of a bad situation, she's like a fish out of water. To me she just another of trumps victims.
