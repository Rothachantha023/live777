965375266913751041 2018-02-18 18:59:34 -0400 <DarrellFrank> @billtaverner @realDonaldTrump The answer in my opinion is not necessarily Gun control but rather fix the problems that exist . HIPPA laws are the reason that background checks do not catch people who have mental illness . If a person has been seen by any psyche then it's protected even if they are on meds.

In the heat of a crisis like this, first responders don"t have time to figgure out who the good guys are. It"s shoot first and ask questions later.

The tRump isn't going to sanction Russia, they're his only chance to retain any power ; it's how he got elected in the first place.
965374859122327553 2018-02-18 18:57:56 -0400 <JanetLGO> @ccollinshockey @realDonaldTrump I have never felt this level of hatred or disdain for another person...EVER. But when I start to feel bad about it, I remember how hateful he is. How many people he's hurt and the millions he choses to diminish. He's a vile human being. A disgrace to the human race.

The embarrassment he has caused @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP on the world stage is appalling. I’m no fan of any of the Trump family but she doesn’t deserve to be ridiculed so publicly. Shame on him.

Nobody is suggesting taking every firearm away from every American. What’s wrong with suggesting confirmation of ones ID when there is transactions via Gunshows or internet purchases.
