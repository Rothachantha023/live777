Yet, the Fed has raised the rate 7 times under Trump. The Feds do NOT raise rates in a bad economy because they know the economy cannot withstand it. They ONLY raise rates in strong economies.

1029879733138468867 2018-08-15 19:57:17 -0400 <FPatriot2018> @realDonaldTrump  Remember when Donald Trump said he was going to be way to busy to play golf and criticized President Obama 27 times for doing so? Well, Donald Trump has golfed more than Obama did in 8 years. Guess the saber-rattling was just that, Republican hypocrisy @GOP

1029879584353931266 2018-08-15 19:56:41 -0400 <MrEdwardsIsIn> @realDonaldTrump is a sham President @JohnBrennan . He’s a sham man, a sham person. He demonstrates daily his unfitness for the office of President. If only Congressional Republicans had your integrity.  How can they be so short-sighted? Thank you.

And yes, I was a little wimp who was always picked last. How perceptive of you. But I grew nearly a foot in a year &amp; became the guy that does the picking. I do have to work now so gonna have 2 block u.

1029879579962494976 2018-08-15 19:56:40 -0400 <scbona> @thehill @RandPaul and @RealdonaldTrump are so  #Petty #ThinSkinned #Childish #Vindictive #Afraid of criticism Willing to forget First Amendment and their oath to protect Constitution and #Stupid to think revoking clearance will slow down a patriot like @JohnBrennan for a single second!
1029879578687229952 2018-08-15 19:56:40 -0400 <taradublinrocks> No, @JohnBrabender, @realDonaldTrump is not “just like Don Rickles” because everybody loved Don Rickles &amp; Republicans aren’t funny @hardball @HardballChris #Hardball #ImpeachTrump

1029879577600905217 2018-08-15 19:56:40 -0400 <OnlyInCANEh> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Rather childish actually and it’s never OK to vandalize other’s property!
1029879575617134593 2018-08-15 19:56:39 -0400 <MsMiaSharp> @DaddyDaddymac @realDonaldTrump @GOP i will vote against these criminals.
1029879575113740288 2018-08-15 19:56:39 -0400 <WhiteHouseWacko> @realDonaldTrump is just grateful Putin is allowing him to keep his security clearance.

1029879573029109760 2018-08-15 19:56:39 -0400 <FreshSpellbound> @realDonaldTrump You have no understanding or compassion. You are hated. You probably love it. How the fuck do you sleep at night?  REUNITE THOSE CHILDREN W THEIR PARENTS!!!!! NOW! You are such a pathetic excuse of a man. Your wife should divorce you and take everything.
1029879572941008896 2018-08-15 19:56:39 -0400 <SleihySusan> @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @JohnBrennan Brennan &amp; other former Intelligence officials each have 30 to 40 years of intelligence knowledge &amp; wisdom. The US will be vulnerable with this type of brain drain! We certainly cannot count on Trump appointed political appointees  who lack experience &amp; are inept!!
1029879572609884160 2018-08-15 19:56:39 -0400 <gspence1> @EverettTate3 @JohnEissler @PhillipVote2018 @realDonaldTrump Actually, Everett, what I'm trying to do is figure out what you actually know . Thus far, you haven't shown any indication that you have any idea of the truth in regards to this subject. If that pisses you off...that's on you, homeboy.

1029879569472471040 2018-08-15 19:56:38 -0400 <corny203> Dear World (including @JohnBrennan ),  Please hold on a little bit longer... The US "President" @realdonaldtrump, with his "Erratic Behavior," should be losing his own security clearance very soon.  Sincerely, #impeachtrumpnow #Resist #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
1029879567513780226 2018-08-15 19:56:37 -0400 <stewartmandy> Everyone knows @realDonaldTrump used the N word - why not with everything else he's said? Even @PressSec knows it and for once isn't lying for him. That in itself confirms it's true. The release of the tapes will seal it. The worst part is that his supporters will love him more.
1029879564737175552 2018-08-15 19:56:37 -0400 <dm78218> @USNavy @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @drum10thmtn @DeptofDefense But never mentioned the real American hero it’s named for, and you didn’t either! God bless Senator John McCain!
