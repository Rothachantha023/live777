1169037351202500608 2019-09-03 19:59:58 -0400 <ondinemonet> @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Trump said he'd build up our military, what he actually did was discharge members of LGBTQ community. Now he's stealing from the military budget to build a wall that's not feasible. He promised Mexico would pay for the wall... they are not.  #PromisesMadePromisesNotKept
1169037349977821184 2019-09-03 19:59:58 -0400 <DZ4771> @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump is a LOSER  Did Mexico pay for a wall? NO Did RNK quit building nukes? NO Did manufacturing come back? NO Did mining come back? NO Did the tax cut for the 1% work? NO Did a trade war with China work? NO Did economy skyrocket? NO  Inheriting money is all he’s done

1169037299285467137 2019-09-03 19:59:46 -0400 <DonXQuixote> @realDonaldTrump BTW:  From the .@GOP GREAT Recession, .@BarackObama brought us from 10% unemployment (Oct '09) to 4.7% for .@POTUS who brought it ALL the way DOWN to 3.7%! From BIG tax cut ($1.5T debt) GDP bounced from 2.1% to 3.1% (for 4 ONLY quarters) - then, BACK to 2.1%! LOOK at the CHARTS!

Lower taxes and deregulation provided incentives for industry to reinvest, expand and create jobs. The Obama economy was stagnant for 8 years and was the worst economic recovery experienced by our nation. POTUS deserves credit for growth.
