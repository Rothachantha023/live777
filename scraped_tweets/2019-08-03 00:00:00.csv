1157802839399378944 2019-08-03 19:58:02 -0400 <VictoriaECM> While @realDonaldTrump continues to spew disparaging remarks about African Americans and inner cities, what is he going to say about white men who commit all of these mass murders? Is it fine because the murderers are white? Why won‚Äôt he speak out about this hatred?

No fan of @realDonaldTrump, but glad the @DNC got a bloody nose over this.
