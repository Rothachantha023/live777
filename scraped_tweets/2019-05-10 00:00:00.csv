Instead supporting over 800 military bases around the world, why not deploy them at your own borders, where they are most necessary?

However your original comment comparing PK to Donald Trump was pretty crazy and even worse given you're a former foreign minister. Surely you were just having a unguarded moment on Twitter and you really don't think that!!

1126999321445117952 2019-05-10 19:55:51 -0400 <davekenyon01> @realDonaldTrump So the tariffs have already cost jobs and could cause millions more. America is making millions from the American people instead of China now. The government may see some money, but the people don‚Äôt because they pay for it in a different way. But people are buying his garbage.
