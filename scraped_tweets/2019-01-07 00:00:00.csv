I enjoy/enjoyed good reads/journalism from real ethical true professionals.

Nothing you have to say is of interest to me unless it's you have decided NOT to build the stupid ineffective wall! You are the nat'l emergency. Once you are out of office, no nat'l emergency! #WorstPresidentEver

This is not tedious, it is at least a false equivalancy and at worst hypocrisy.

His team are war hawks wanting to remain and in AFG
