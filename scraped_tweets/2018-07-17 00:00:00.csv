A "better" meeting is with an adversarial government that sabotaged our elections and prove who the real "captive to Russia" is.

1019370534067417089 2018-07-17 19:57:28 -0400 <msbrown99991> @rlteiken @mmpadellan It's pretty hard to play eight-dimensional chess when @realDonaldTrump can't think in two-dimensions, speaks at a third-grade level, and lies like a rug. My dog has more credibility and could lead better than trump. He's the perfect republican.

1019370532922449920 2018-07-17 19:57:28 -0400 <Kristen1881> @realDonaldTrump Fox News is also going crazy so you can pretty much just say news now.

1019370526119219200 2018-07-17 19:57:27 -0400 <nico_of_lions> @Wesihcfan @JoycieDee @realDonaldTrump Therefore it is Trump that is ignoring agreements.  Until just a few years ago, who would be arguing that Germany should be spending more money on its military? Things take time. Trump is painting US allies in a negative light when they have done nothing wrong.

Why would he care if he is disbarred.   I guess this is like Trump who could not get a gambling license in Australia to open casinos in the country because they felt he was too close to the mob.
1019370524382769152 2018-07-17 19:57:26 -0400 <swon26> Treasonous, appeaser, mafioso @realDonaldTrump! You're puppet of murderer Putin who has something(s) on you! PERIOD! You said he's "fine" as you said about KKK "they're fine people too". Thug Putin OWN YOU! PERIOD! Thanks @HelsinkiComm for showing the world who gangster Putin is!  https://t.co/I07jcrGzGC

It‚Äôs being ‚Äúhidden‚Äù which is total opposite.  When people are liars that‚Äôs what they do. Both men are 100% untrustworthy.  Putin murders people with no feeling, Trump kills America with no regret
