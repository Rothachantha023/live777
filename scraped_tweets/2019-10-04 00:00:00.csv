1180270964506071040 2019-10-04 19:58:20 -0400 <be_report> @realDonaldTrump Quit trying to troll someone into finding out who the whistleblower is. QUIT TRYING TO INTIMIDATE WITNESSES. There is a reason for wb laws. It's so you and your followers can't ruin his/her life. Inncocent people don't try to shut down investigations before they start.
