1100545455648235520 2019-02-26 18:57:38 -0400 <ChristinaStock1> @realDonaldTrump In 13 states that you won in 2016, your approval rating is now underwater.   In no state that Trump won in 2016 is his approval rating worse than in Texas. 57% will not vote for you again.
1100545454687817730 2019-02-26 18:57:38 -0400 <plaintalking1> @JaceRidley @realDonaldTrump Yes I do follow the Pres I voted for him. And I am not ashamed of it.

This protects the mother's right not to carry a child who would not be able to live outside the womb. Or one who is so severely deformed and sick they would suffer tremendously. You really need to just shut up. #ResignNow
