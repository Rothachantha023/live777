1168674303816196096 2019-09-02 19:57:21 -0400 <cccq0756> @realDonaldTrump Gaslighting again . You are the one who made racist attacks, against Mexicans, against Muslims. You called Nazis fine people. You take Russia's side against the American intelligence agencies. Your horrible comments are far worse than anything they actually said.

1168674299940458496 2019-09-02 19:57:20 -0400 <NightmareHolic> @LoveIsabella72 @realDonaldTrump @SteveHiltonx The whole idea that you can force China to buy more from the USA by tarrifing the US businesses sounds ludicrous to me.  1) Isn't the US for Free market, not artificial Supply and Demand? 2) Not China's fault that the US buys China products.  3) Tariffs tax US imports.

Have you never exaggerated or embellished on something at one of your rallies? The media is the media. Govern above it. The results will take care of themselves, sir.
