1066118456234266624 2018-11-23 18:57:02 -0400 <LemBillings> @realDonaldTrump @USTreasury @stevenmnuchin1 The level of junior high discourse from trumpland is continuously stunning.
1066118456171511809 2018-11-23 18:57:02 -0400 <cody_enneking> @realannapaulina @realDonaldTrump you’ve got to be the most ignorant human beings ever . Obama never separated children and the parents. Just because we don’t agree on issues in politics doesn’t make us enemy’s we are Americans. Start acting Like it. Even if Obama did do it that makes it right for trump to do it.
1066118455005392896 2018-11-23 18:57:01 -0400 <waf2ct> @realDonaldTrump No need for a wall. Spend the money on healthcare and education. And get the troops off the boarder. We are NOT being invaded only lied to.
