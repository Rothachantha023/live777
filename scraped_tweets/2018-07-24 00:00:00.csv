When retaliatory tariffs were instituted on steel, the hurt was far greater than Whirlpool expected.

Seriously, your immature insult aside, look into what he's been up to over the last few years. It's a story of redemption.

The claim that she wants to focus on Washington  is laughable because she's done nothing and silent on women's issues.

Putin is a duplicitous bastard that you can only believe is always looking out for himself.  Putin could be trolling the media, but since Trump is doing everything Putin could hope for, it's probably the cold hard truth.
