1080614593355964416 2019-01-02 18:59:30 -0400 <Moe_Fabuleux> Trump ran a campaign on making Mexico pay for the wall, not America.  Mexico refused to pay for the wall (obviously). Trump shuts down the govt because Dems won't approve funding to pay for the wall.  ü§îü§î  #trumplogic @realDonaldTrump stop  being a baby and be a damn president.

That is why a President has to know how to lead and bring people together.  This is the worst President the US has had and there have been some bad one and we survived.  A person needs to earn respect.

Sin embargo, comprob√© gracias a una petici√≥n que lance en @Change, que ustedes los medios, son la puta met√°stasis de la industria de los videojuegos. Realmente existen las Fake News, y soy testigo.
1080614072394178561 2019-01-02 18:57:26 -0400 <Dixon18Dem> @realDonaldTrump Like this assertion: "Were asking for $5.6 (billion). Somebody said $2.5 billion." That "somebody" was Vice President Mike Pence and OMB Director/Acting Chief of Staff/dogsbody Mick Mulvaney, who told Democrats last week that Trump would accept the lower figure.
1080614070938726401 2019-01-02 18:57:26 -0400 <juspasinthru2> @realDonaldTrump Well if Mexico is paying for the wall, and a lot of it is built, then we don't need any wall money, because you don't pay contractors anyway. So what is your problem??  Get off your ego trip and work for the country.

1080614066463350785 2019-01-02 18:57:24 -0400 <leoxsouza> @realDonaldTrump @jairbolsonaro Continuation The PT and its leftist allies joined together through the Sao Paulo forum to finance the Bolivarian power project. May God Bless and Wisdom President Bolsonaro in his administration. Congratulations to President Trump for his management in the USA.

1080614056887758848 2019-01-02 18:57:22 -0400 <RonBear2> @realDonaldTrump You criticised President Obama for the same thing saying he left a void for ISIS to regroup and now (apparently) it's your turn. At least you listened to brighter minds (for once) and gave 4 months before pull out and not 30 days as you originally announced.

The media is aware of their enormous power and they use it to lead the political establishment. That is why they hate @realDonaldTrump. Never have I seen such persistent attacks by the MSM on any political leader.
