If majority(being generous here) wants something, that does not mean judges should allow that. If most want to put Mr. X in prison, and you pass an exec order for that, it will get overturned if X has committed no crime.

1065394321527111680 2018-11-21 18:59:34 -0400 <SwiftLilEagle> @GinnyJean23 @realDonaldTrump Also haven't really seen another administration be in this kind of situation (i.e. where a country with power does this kind of act). Please understand that I'm not condoning what Trump did. I just think that in this scenario, it's hard to say exactly what the good move was.

How do you, as a Democratic Party and US leader, continually insist that the President curb his schoolyard rhetoric, and then spew something like this? You are better than that and this hurts your credibility. An unforced error by you.

But more than 82,000 veterans are -- facing eviction, getting kicked out of school, going into debt as benefits are delayed.
