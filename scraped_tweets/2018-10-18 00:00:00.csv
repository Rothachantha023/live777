1053072776179912704 2018-10-18 19:58:09 -0400 <seanbianca> @seanhannity Life as we know it. Republicans must win the midterms! If they do not the blame falls on both @realDonaldTrump and Republicans themselves. Not repealing and replacing Obamacare and not building the wall could cost Republicans the midterms.

I do stand with you to penalize countries who do nothing to help protect our mutual borders. If we must close the southern border to stop this northward stampede, so be it. ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏
