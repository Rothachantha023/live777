We had to rebuild the military and Dems demanded an equal increase in domestic spending without even having a specific need. The tax cuts were $1.5T but they increased GDP &amp; tax revenues. In 2018 the deficit was $779B In 2010 Obama‚Äôs was $1.5T.

The people or individuals promoting that type of speech should not be given a platform on social media or elsewhere.
