The story is his recovery, from building to branding, heavily scrutinized by the institutions he owed millions to, the IRS and NJ gambling comm. Look the guy is flawed no doubt but he didn't crumble under the pressure
1125913001029246981 2019-05-07 19:59:12 -0400 <shailja_s> So basically @realDonaldTrump is asking untrained officers to decide the lives of asylum seekers. How‚Äôs that for an asylum policy? U.S. asylum screeners to take more confrontational approach as Trump aims to turn more migrants away at the border  https://t.co/LTAsL7FUos
