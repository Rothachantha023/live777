1000888808936701952 2018-05-27 19:57:42 -0400 <gosilent> @ColMorrisDavis @realDonaldTrump @CNNSotu I am reading Jim Clapper's new book. He seems like a good person. I love that his wife is still wearing the $150 wedding ring he gave her. What a love story.  The book is really interesting and important. I pick and choose my non-fiction books carefully. I trust Jim Clapper.

The odds of you screwing up this whole deal are astronomical which is what has both Americans and our allies very worried.

I could be wrong but I think it was 7. No indictments. So far, how many indictments has Mueller gotten in his ongoing investigation?  You don‚Äôt have a clue.
