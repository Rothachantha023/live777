The problem was that too many leftists wanted Trump to face KILLary so they flooded the Republican tickets to be sure Trump won. You can say Cruz lost both battles. Now, for the good of the country, he's setting personal ambitions aside.

He spends all day just looking for ways to validate his stupid existence rather than doing any real work. Trump is a waste of life. Trump would kill himself if the press stopped talking about him. As he used to
950517138632200192 2018-01-08 18:58:40 -0400 <teamgravy2012> @realDonaldTrump  Anyway you can have the IRS have a box for donations for the building of the Wall on next years taxes? By the way You're doing a Great Job at Making America Great Again!

950517133955489794 2018-01-08 18:58:39 -0400 <huber_derek> @realDonaldTrump In my experience, if you want to be respected, you have to be respectable. We have a government that caters to the 1% and then gets agitated when we don’t worship the flag. It’s getting difficult to be patriotic with the nonstop circus this archaic administration has been.

950517130692263937 2018-01-08 18:58:38 -0400 <johnnyblaze563> @realDonaldTrump To all haters... What have you done to help farmers?
950517129660522497 2018-01-08 18:58:38 -0400 <lacieb1> @Johnbeverage3 @PaulaBonaFide @realDonaldTrump Lol, how many small farms do you think invest in the Stock market? Go spend some time working a small farm then decide how he has helped the small farmer. Maybe in McDonald's Hamburger purchases but that's not small farmers that produce the meat or veggies that go on it.

If you actually don’t know that it’s “illegal immigrants” that get deported you should watch a different news channel.  Tell ya what. Name a legal immigrant that got deported without breaking the law.

I've seen squirrels with bigger attention spans than you.   The press wants respect. The country wants respect. We also want you to actually respect the presidency and act like a leader.
950517105799122944 2018-01-08 18:58:32 -0400 <Leslieannscott> @realDonaldTrump Very sweet but the doubt most farmers have the time to tweet and read tweets
