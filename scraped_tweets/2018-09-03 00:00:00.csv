Neither did the 1850s wave of Chinese immigrants in the pacific west, nor the the Jews, the Italians, the Puerto Ricans, the Haitians, and all the other mass immigration waves this country has absorbed in the many decades since.

1036765168590577664 2018-09-03 19:57:33 -0400 <RHStoll_III> @realDonaldTrump So it's Jeff Sessions fault that they got caught stealing campaign funds for personal use.  They deserve to be arrested, tried &amp; convicted.  As you and your family do.

1036765159753232385 2018-09-03 19:57:30 -0400 <CJlegalBeagle> @CassandraRules @realDonaldTrump It's so bizarre when westerners tell Assad he'd better not do something to foreign jihadists or foreign soldiers in Syria.  There's no way the 2001 AUMF covers this.  We've been backing al Qaeda-linked groups.  What a MCF.
