b'@realDonaldTrump We give up the day you: prove Mexico is paying for the wall; you reveal your "beautiful" healthcare plan you touted pre and post-campaign; you show your tax returns (even Nixon disclosed his although still under audit); negotiate with Big Pharma for drug prices; so many lies!'

b"@realDonaldTrump And that's the way it should go. The Mueller report (minus redactions agreed to by the Gang of Eight-majority vote required to redact) should be on a public website as quickly as possible. Only full transparency will be enough to allow all to believe that they are fully informed."
