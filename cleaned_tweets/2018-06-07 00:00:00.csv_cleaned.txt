b'@realDonaldTrump Do you think that he is going to reply you. 30years ago I have stolen my neighbor\'s Dove . I admitted that to him three months ago . His comment was " time out of money. According to him, I should give him 30 doves. This is the case'

b'@VanJones68 @CNN @KimKardashian @realDonaldTrump Nobody cares. Really. 2 people famous for being craven. They can rut with each other. Maybe Kimye will let little Donnie watch.'
b'@VanJones68 @CNN @KimKardashian @realDonaldTrump so is there now some redeeming thing about Trump ? I think probably so considering his predecessor did commute this womans life sentence'

b'@realDonaldTrump Anyway, I just wanted to get that off my chest before I talk about something that *really* matters and is not getting enough attention, (or if you watch Fox News, you might not know about at all.) There are children in America kept in cages. https://t.co/cdJLVVR6vj'

b"@realDonaldTrump Everyone should know this is Obama's economy, trump just takes credit for every ones else's accomplishments. Will be sad when he puts us back into recession."
b'@realDonaldTrump I will bet you not too many top notch lawyers give a crap about what Dershowitz says ...Given a choice between Avenatti and Dershowitz, I pick Avenatti every day of the week and twice on Sunday ... Now given you got Rudy working for you I can appreciate why Dershowitz dazzles you'

b'Wondering if @RandPaul is also in favor of @realDonaldTrump being interviewed by Mueller. Also, Senator Rand Paul should have @DonaldJTrumpJr testify under oath and press him on his bogus client-privilege argument.  https://t.co/vDqYB4dQXS'
