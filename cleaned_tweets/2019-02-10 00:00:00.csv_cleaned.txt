b'@realDonaldTrump How much Executive Time did you waste thinking about &amp; then tweeting out such a dumbass comment as this to begin with? Not to mention the number of hamburgers consumed while you pouted about after the disclosure of your schedule in the first place'

b'@ConservativeJC0 @BitchOnomics @973angie @realDonaldTrump Under prior law, taxpayers whose unreimbursed medical expenses exceeded 10% of their adjusted gross income (AGI) could deduct that excess. Under the TCJA, taxpayers may deduct unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of their AGI. In other words, you gained 2.5%'
