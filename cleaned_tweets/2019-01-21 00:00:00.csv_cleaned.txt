b"@realDonaldTrump FEAR ! FEAR ! FEAR ! HATE ! HATE ! HATE ! For fuck's sake man, change the station,"
b'@realDonaldTrump No one has said there shouldnt be border security. But its naive to think a wall on one border will stop the influx. Spread the security around to the ports, the northern, western &amp; eastern borders. Use technology, more manpower, &amp; make it smarter not harder.'
b'@realDonaldTrump Build The Wall!!!'
b'@realDonaldTrump YOU are the humanitarian crisis. OPEN THE GOVERNMENT'
b'@amuneton @realDonaldTrump Probably lining his pockets first, then paying off the Russian mobsters not to feed him and his drumpfettes to the sharks.'

b'@realDonaldTrump Many little children shot by a radical white guy, multiple high school,students shot by a radical white guy?? maybe. We should ban white guys???'
b'@smalltownandrew @FiIibuster @realDonaldTrump My prayer for the President is that he stays strong. I feel he was elected because God needed someone to cary out his will, to appoint enough common sense judges to return America back to Constitutional rule of law. God Bless President Trump.MAGA.'
b'@BuffaloTracer @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The Atlantic? Really? Biased much?'
b'@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse It wont stop it. It could possibly limit it or at least make it harder but it wont stop. People who are evil enough to do that shit arent gonna see the wall/ barrier and be like oh darn! I guess Ill just turn around and give up.'
b"@realDonaldTrump You want your wall? First get the government up and running, then we'll talk. Letting YOU blackmail Congress to get what YOU want is a bad precedent to set and Chuck and Nancy should hold their ground on that."
b'@realDonaldTrump Tell her to take down the wall around her house here in Napa , where she likes to hire ppl without the right paperwork. Does she pay under the table , does she pay tax , Sao , workmans comp . I need to know.'
b"@realDonaldTrump How do you think human trafficking happens outside of legal ports of entry? Do you think they're herding people over the border like cows?"
b"@realDonaldTrump Why aren't you putting up a wall around Florida?"
b'@realDonaldTrump Jeez Crooked Donald thats gunna be one hell of a busy wall! Will it also bring world peace and stop world starvation, put water back into dry rivers......!'
b'@realDonaldTrump Oooooo scary. Been watching FOX today huh? Oh, and NO WALL.'
b"@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Given your lack of being able to deal with China, they are now dealing with Russia. Explain that to American Soybean and poultry farmers now waiting for aid caused by your tariffs and piss poor trade acumen. And the shutdown isn't helping them either. #TrumpShutdown"
b'@EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump And at least one Republican congressman @HurdOnTheHill William Hurd with 41% of the border in his district says we dont need a physical wall but #smartwall alternatives'
b'@kenolin1 @realDonaldTrump So what? Thats for this totally useless mileage lesson.'
b'@realDonaldTrump Stop playing games and pay the government workers and end the shut down. I am sure you are getting paid. This is getting a bit childish. Please end the shutdown and stop toying with the American people!'
b'@SenJohnHoeven @realDonaldTrump Unless the house can reign in Pelosi, Congress is not going to budget for border security.'
b'@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Oh no are you to start talking about your white privilege'
b'@realDonaldTrump Thats not the cause at all, but nice try.'
b'@mikebwonder @realDonaldTrump @POTUS No. Its a @SpeakerPelosi @chuckschumer shutdown.'
b'@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/SEgFgRpKvq'
b'@realDonaldTrump This tweet is stupid. Stop holding federal workers hostage!! Coast Guard has food pantries.'
b"@realDonaldTrump Maybe start thinking about the Americans who are waiting in bread lines today just to feed their families because of your shut down. This is truly an outrage that people with jobs can't feed their children."
b"@Marty_Shannon @realDonaldTrump Yeah, whatever happened to that oh so dangerous 'crisis' at the border??? Oh yeah - the mid-terms!!!"
b'@realDonaldTrump HaHa the king of Fake News.'
b'@RDTCSC @realDonaldTrump Couldnt be Stephen Miller, thats for sure.'
b'@realDonaldTrump Stop playing games and give America the the President it deserves. A Constitutional Crisis!'
b'@realDonaldTrump I feel your time would be better spent with Mueller, you could be making the deal of your life staying out of prison in return for a detailed accounting of the myriad crimes of your life and your treason to Russia. What have you got to lose?'
b'@realDonaldTrump We need to shut him up! Voice your thoughts and sign this petition showing him that we want to end the shutdown without a wall! https://t.co/FDYip32zpO'

b'@JohnnyNova4 @Jainiand2cats @realDonaldTrump "In fact, ..., the outcome would have been the same." "the Russians had already turned the tide and German forces were in full retreat across Europe." "Contrary to American mythology, the Soviets deserve the lion\'s share of the credit for victory in Europe."'
b'@JacobAWohl @jetrotter @realDonaldTrump But how else would the Democratic Party survive? '
b'@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Gee we got some parking tickets. So what'
b'@realDonaldTrump Im far more afraid of racist Trump supporting gun fanatics than I am immigrants.'
b"@SonOfGodAndMan @realDonaldTrump And he's shoving it down the Democrats throat"
b'@realDonaldTrump Over 8000 lies. Trump was talking business with foreign advisory who was in midst of attacking our election (in his favor). #TrumpShutdown2019 over a political stunt he promised 35% of America..Mexico isnt payin...shovels and blowtorches through or under a ridiculous wall thing.'
b'@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Youre kidding yourself if you think a wall will stop Chinese fentanyl, or white-male-Christian mass shootings, or pedophiles like Jeffrey Epstein...or that all of that comes from the southern border.'
b'@thehill Have to delay announcement to prepare next round of mystery funeral notes @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump #MAGA'
b'@realDonaldTrump Boy you really latched onto the word "humanitarian" didn\'t you. You have no concept, within that diseased mind, what the word means. And you most certainly shall never act as a humanitarian does.'

b'@realDonaldTrump Grow up.'
b'@realDonaldTrump Instead of saying, "thank you - you are great patriots" why don\'t you try saying, "I\'m sorry for putting you through this" and reopening the govt? You created this problem. Take you lumps and end it, like a real man instead of acting like a petulant, spoiled child.'
b'@movieator @realDonaldTrump Spot on!'
b"@realDonaldTrump The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Wait. It's snow. Still waiting for our president to start spreading hope instead of fear. (Start adding up the number of unarmed victims of police shootings and homegrown crime, and you'll see why I'm so cynical about your warnings.)"
b"@realDonaldTrump If they don't believe it, then they're not kidding themselves."
b'@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Caroline Kennedy was not allowed to keep the dolls that heads of state gave her... emoluments clause, they are in a museum. I may be wrong, but shouldnt Ivankas patents belong to USA, not her? Dolls/patents? No gifts from foreign governments.'
