b'So, do you think that our fearless leader @realDonaldTrump will pardon Jeffrey Epstein?'
b'@realDonaldTrump Now that we all know "Make America Great Again" was originally a kuku klutz klan motto, we understand that this is Trump\'s battlecry to his base of racist supremacists. Every single time he uses it, hes invoking action from the same audience of crazies that mass murders.'

b'@tedlieu @GeorgeTakei @realDonaldTrump Trump\'s gotta make Clinton a patsy because we all know that between Clinton and Trump, Trump\'s the one that has the most evidence into dealing with Epstein\'s kiddy ring, and therefore is the most likely the one who had him "suicided"'
b'@w_terrence @realDonaldTrump Thank you for re-tweeting this Mr.President.'
b'@TheRynheart @w_terrence @realDonaldTrump How is this not another instance of obstruction of justice (as well as libel, conduct unbecoming against a private citizen minding her business being a grandmother.)'

b'@realDonaldTrump Heck Yea. The great negotiator .'
b'@w_terrence @realDonaldTrump RTing this?! Anything to get ppls minds off the fact that not only was this pedophile your "close friend" at one point, but at another said he was a "very fine man".

b'@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Trump benefits from Epsteins death.'
b'@grande_again @maziehirono @realDonaldTrump The unbelievable dread of any discussion is amazing. A United States Senator and you call her batshit crazy.

b'@realDonaldTrump This was 2016. The woman, who had filed suit earlier this year under the pseudonym Jane Doe, had alleged that Trump and billionaire Jeffrey Epstein had raped her in 1994, when she was a 13-year-old aspiring model. https://t.co/iTSxaAo12x'

b'@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Barr is doing Trump\'s dirty work for him, again. Epstein was in DOJ custody. DOJ announced "suicide" BEFORE an ME examined the body. Barr\'s dad hired Epstein.

b'@real_defender @realDonaldTrump Sleezy Don Trump is despised by many. Joe Biden is a moral, ethical, compassionate, experienced, thoughtful superstar compared to Connie Trump.
