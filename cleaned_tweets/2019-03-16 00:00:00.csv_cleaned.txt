b'@mvnewberry @TheSauceDeity @MichaelaLynn_34 @realDonaldTrump @GovRicketts Nope. Some areas are having cooler temperatures. They are far outnumbered by the warmer regions, but global warming is still not correct. The affect on habitat is a characteristic of climate change. The vortexes are going to happen far more often in the future.'

b'@realDonaldTrump Yes dear leader, I am sure they all obey their master. Thats the way Democracy works.'
b'@realDonaldTrump John McCain may never have been @POTUS But he was an American Hero and was, by far, more respected and Presidential than you can ever hope to be! Taking shots at him, after his death, is below the dignity of your office and you should be ashamed.'
