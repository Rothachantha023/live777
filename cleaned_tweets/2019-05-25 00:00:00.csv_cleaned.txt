b'@realDonaldTrump Careful! The Democrats are going to try to say you colluded with North Korean to win the presidency.'
b'@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Republicans can easily own the high ground on this issue since Dems have pretty much tipped their hand on advocating healthcare by the government only. There is so much middle ground on the issue that they have abandoned and conservative can control.'
