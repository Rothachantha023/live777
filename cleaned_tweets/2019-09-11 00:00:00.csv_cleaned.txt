b'@realDonaldTrump All you do is whine. Geesh! Grow up!'
b'@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @USGAO Trump has done nothing for this wonderful country except bow to the evangelicals like Falwell who himself sounds like he may have a checkered past. How can you protest to be a Christian &amp; have all the hate displayed by evangelicals?'
b"@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/xLDGjMJQtj ... Our Pres appears to need an understanding heart, a gentle touch in this conflicted time. Melania is not adapted to deal with intl &amp; cosmic issues--she's a Model, a pretty lady, not her Husband's PEER. COLD--let her move ON."
