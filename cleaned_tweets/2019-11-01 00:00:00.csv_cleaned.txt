b'@TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump You dont need to know anything about the whistleblower. If he/she is a Trump-hater or not is irrelevant. His duty was only to get attention to the corruption. The evidence will be found in the following investigation and revealed in the impeachment hearings.'
b"@realDonaldTrump But someone who HAS done something wrong can be impeached--so while you may believe you've done nothing wrong, a good portion of America believes you have... it will be more after the evidence against you is made public."
