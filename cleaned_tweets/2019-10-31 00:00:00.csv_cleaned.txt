b'@realDonaldTrump FAKE NEWS by Donald Teump!! By the hour he is getting worse and even more evil: this man @realDonaldTrump is a disgrace to his country, to civilization and to the office of President of such a great nation the US still is despite him.'
b"@realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle But it's a doctored release. Vindman pointed that out. You are a danger to the Constitution."
b'@Hdurand7 @EthanDougall @SexCounseling @realDonaldTrump You know there is no way someone who isnt a citizen can vote legally right? So how does "illEAGLE" votes get into this conversation'
b"@realDonaldTrump The republicans don't work for you. They like you, work for the people. You are a lying corrupt individual. They are not there to defend you, and if they do they should all be put out of office."

b'@RepDougCollins @realDonaldTrump Its about upholding our constitution and the rule of law! He probably met with you and conned the crap out of you! He is a Delusional Traitor who only gets by by lying and conning people.The only thing partisan is your refusal to accept that Trump is a National Security Threat'
b'@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/N8QB1oLDWW'
b'@RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump Keep up the good fight. Thanks for all you are doing. I think as the president you should be able to question a country of corruption before you give them millions of dollars of tax payers money. They should be investigating Bid on.'

b"@RickK13949616 @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump Reading Americans can see that this isn't a full transcript. AND we can see that it is extremely questionable even as written. Outside testimony makes it look much worse, as it amplifies the quid pro quo nature of the conversation."
b'@RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump markie mark! Apparently, youre forgetting that the other two were not serious bc, wisely, the speaker of your chamber was not on board. Things are a bit different now, so you may wanna tell yer boy donnie to have movers on standby.'

b'@Scriptdoll2 @rutstrutt @jleannsmreker @AngelaBelcamino @MetalGal @realDonaldTrump Its called an indirect election. In the US, we elect representatives to vote for us.

b'@realDonaldTrump Yes sir! BTW when Biden said Trump should be impeached, didnt he at that time interfere with the election? It certainly appears to be that way to many, many of us.'
