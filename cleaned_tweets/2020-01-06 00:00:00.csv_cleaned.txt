b"@pantherlily141 @ddanpereira @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi You're right! Trump issuing record sanctions on Russia, including any company that does business on their pipeline to Europe, freezing accounts of oligarchs close to Putin, sending lethal aid to Ukraine, and taking out an Iranian General is somehow obeying Putin."
b'@SecPompeo @kbsalsaud @StateDept @realDonaldTrump But now, instead of buckling to American pressure, Iran declared on Sunday that those restrictions are over  a decade ahead of schedule. Mr. Trumps gambit has effectively backfired. https://t.co/XtCwHlHQPk'

b'@realDonaldTrump Duh, the last we checked all these cities are in the USA, and you are responsible for your reckless economic decisions that are increasing homelessness across the country. These homelesd people then migrate to cities that are willing to help them and keep them alive.'
