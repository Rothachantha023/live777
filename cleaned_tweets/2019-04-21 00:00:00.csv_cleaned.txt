b'@realDonaldTrump Huh?'
b'@TimRunsHisMouth @realDonaldTrump Trump wont get re-elected. His base isnt enough to do the job, Trump has alienated many of the independents who voted for him, Hillary isnt running again, and the Democrats arent complacent like in 2016.'
b"@dunwunder @miniappleman @DogginTrump @realDonaldTrump No I haven't the time like an investigation team does. But this morning I do keep up with every individual that is part of everything in the witch Hunt through Dan Bongeno, hannity and Judicial Watch.

b'@qanon76 @realDonaldTrump Its too true. As the public awakens to proof of all the ways Trump obstructed Justice (10 examples in Mueller Report), the ones who are not brain dead (or cultists) will make him pay for it.'
b'@realDonaldTrump Watch and see...'
b"@realDonaldTrump Here's what really happened. Manafort &amp; Stone, Trump's buddy's put together an opp to get Trump elected with the help of the Russians. They did it for mob money &amp; to see if they could get away with it! Are we gonna let them? #ImpeachTrump #HillaryWonTrumpCheated"

b'@HuckleberryBull @ESmithinAR479 @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Yeah, actually thats fairly spot on, Congress does have the authority. In fact, I would infer that if there is any hierarchy to U.S. gov. Congress is just a smidgen above the other branches, after all they (suppose to) act in the interest of the People of The U.S., right?'
