b'@Kamori01 @EmmanuelMacron @realDonaldTrump Thanks for the Holiday cheer. It\'s rich, a #MAGAT calling someone else an "idiot". When you joined the #CULT45, you lost any credibility you may have ever had, though it\'s doubful you\'ve ever exhibited any credibility, on anything.'
b'I sure hope @realDonaldTrump is feeling terrible since he caused all this drama! Dig in, the next 2 years are going to be hell with the dems in control of the House! https://t.co/Q7vVEEXEs4'
b'@AAVENEZOLANA @realDonaldTrump "May be he might be"..?? Seems like English is your third language. I mistook you for an American. I am guessing you did not understand half of what l wrote before. We have a language barrier.'

b"@IvarOlo @PNW_Teacher @foxxylilfoxxW @realDonaldTrump Of course, he is lying. This would be an illegal misappropriation of funds without Congressional approval...which he can't get."

b'@realDonaldTrump Fecking liar! If so its to your lobby friend whos pocket youre in.'
b'@realDonaldTrump Nope!! You scoorge!!!!'
b'@WHOSTP @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @IvankaTrump @POTUS plunged the country into chaos. Stock market is tanking, Trump is waging a personal war on the Fed Reserve  after he just fired the sec of defense. @POTUS wanted the shutdown, but he doesnt know how to get himself out of it. #TrumpResign #JavankaResign #ResignTrump'
b'@realDonaldTrump You have a short memory, you had a deal. Then after listening to Faux News, Coulter, Rush and The Freedom Caucus came this; "If we don\'t get what we want, one way or the other ... I will shut down the government, absolutely." Man Up Own It! The Trump Shutdown !'
b'@realDonaldTrump Cant wait until the DEMOCRATS take over the Senate House. I hope you get a lot of grief...'
b"@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump The only chaos we are in is because of the Democrats. The only personal war raging is the one the Dems have with the American people and our duly elected President. The Gov't shutdown is YOUR fault and We will not surrender! Wall or the shutdown can continue forever."

b'@realDonaldTrump Why in the world do you have great respect for him? What has he actually accomplished in his career? Hes just another stooge who you hope does what you tell him to, no questions asked.'
b'@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Go to bed. You arent getting a wall. How about 5 billion for education? Pre-K? Scholarships? Stop making stuff up like we dont already have solid border security.'
b'@JerameyBullock @thewallsucks @realDonaldTrump Oh and in Israel the wall is guarded heavily by armed military who have orders to shoot to kill, and they do.'

b'@Christie_Foxx @realDonaldTrump Yeah Im sure the Fed rate hikes have nothing to do with that. https://t.co/zIb5CakbS6'
b'@realDonaldTrump I laugh so hard reading all of your tweets. Then I remember that youre the President and thats depressing. Looking forward to a new President January 2021 (if not sooner!).'

b'@realDonaldTrump Quit with the LIES! 1. You have authorization to REPAIR EXISTING STRUCTURES ONLY; no "contracts" to build new structures. 2. Funny,looks like starting at 15:07, YOU pretty much take responsibility for any shutdown. https://t.co/pF9nXE8ehf #TrumpResign #AlertTheDaycareStaff'

b'@realDonaldTrump Your wall is a massive boondoggle! The money has far better uses if its going to be spent. Sinking billions into a cold, inert wall that will ultimately be torn down just as all inert boondoggles are ultimately torn down is the very definition of folly.'
b"@realDonaldTrump You are costing our country the world's admiration and respect. Your presidency is a drain on all that is decent and right with America. Do something good for once and #ResignNow ."
