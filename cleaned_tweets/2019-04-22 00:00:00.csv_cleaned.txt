b'@Ladanieladea @teddyfenton1 @realDonaldTrump And there is not enough evidence of collusion not having occurred either. Its a very grey area there. But obstruction? Several clear counts of it, and firing Mueller would have been another.'

b'@MariaBartiromo @realDonaldTrump @SundayFutures @FoxNews "... we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of collusion.

b'@Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump You know you would think that a guy that can teach /coach at a University level could read and understand written text. I don t recall ever seeing in the report that there was no obstruction. Your whole lot kills me in their stupidity!'
b"@realDonaldTrump That's 100% not what the report said Donnie. The report actually said that Mueller and his team were leaving obstruction up to Congress."
b"@RichardCanfiel5 @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump You're honestly OK with someone intending to break the law but failing only because someone else won't do their dirty work? You'd be OK with not punishing an accountant for attempted embezzlement because they couldn't convince a junior employee to go along with it? Honestly?"
b'@MariaBartiromo @realDonaldTrump @SundayFutures @FoxNews What happened to you?'
b"@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Oh yeah, Donnie got some real Giuliani-level lawyerly advice for that genius move. He has only the best people; the VERY BEST people...somewhere or other. He hasn't seen them for 40 years now, but they're around somewhere. LOL"
