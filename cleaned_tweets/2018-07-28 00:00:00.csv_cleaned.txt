b"@Junior_Samples1 @realDonaldTrump She's a new face in the Bernie mode. She'll never have any power. Nobody sensible talks about unlimited immigration. America was populated-- well, by Indians, and then by people fleeing persecution. We need to keep that in mind when we're working on our immigration laws."
b"@NotOnMyWatch83 @drzaibkhan111 @realDonaldTrump If ppl r deemed 'illegal' then send them back - but don't take the children off them! Some of these children will never see their families again! American ppl are getting NO sense from WH about what has gone on here - they don't know where the parents are they deported!"

Forests invaded by Japanese Barbary jumped from 100 to 1k ticks per acre. Youd think bcz of Marla, Trump would address it. But, during National LD Month (May) he designated it National Exercise Month. Sad.'
