b'@Jillerke @rymbltn @fortismind @realDonaldTrump Actually... (1) How low has he brought the presidency if criminality is the bar. (2) He can be impeached for High Crimes &amp; Misdemeanors, which are not necessarily crimes at all. (3) His corruption is in part how he has used the Presidency to enrich himself through his hotels.'
