b"@realdonaldtrump You really are a sad, pudgy old man. Time to leave the WH. You know you're bored not getting to do what you please without a fight."
b'@jonmichaelolse1 @realDonaldTrump Only way it works is use the Military to confiscate all guns and ammo. Problem is it will be hard to accomplish without confrontations. Then we become a militaristic/police state with cameras everywhere like in Europe.'

b'@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Again,so disgusting. You should cancel the rally. We are going to vote you out and so is Wisconsin. All you do is preach hate and division and then try to pretend you had nothing to do with it when somebody acts on it. You are a disgusting excuse for a human being'

b'@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Trump has no empathy for the victims of synagogue shooting. He could careless. Just listen to his lies at his rally. I would be ashamed to attend his rally.
