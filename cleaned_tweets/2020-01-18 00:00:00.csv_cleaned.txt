b'@aubrey_huff @realDonaldTrump Why do you put 2010 &amp; 2012 in quotes?'
b'@realDonaldTrump The Democrats are only upset because President Trump is trying to fix some of the problems in OUR country. He still continues to work for us through all the adversity everyone has thrown his way. Head down and press on Sir. My family will support President Donald Trump in 2020.'
b'@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Ok. First...There aint an honorable bone in Trumps body. Second...Trump is impeached, forevah! '
b'@BertGoldPhD @VirusesImmunity @realDonaldTrump Interesting - in what way? I think its usually complicated to determine costs per outcome because so much of our work is interdependent, one trainee working on multiple projects, one project needing multiple trainees, one source of funding being used for different things.'
