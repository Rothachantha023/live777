b'@realDonaldTrump The reason that N.F.L. players kneel during "The Star Spangled Banner" is that they are ashamed that you are the President of the United States! You want to build a wall between U.S.A. and Mexico! You separate immigrant children from their immigrant parents!'

b"@C_Noyd @dropbear008 @realDonaldTrump Point is, we are building that wall. We will stop chain illegal migration. There won't be another Mollie Tibbetts if we do this. If a wall is too expensive for you, we can send snipers to the border and voila...problem solved again. Do it while the wall is built. #MAGA"

b'@JonathanLanday @RudyGiuliani There is no allegation of wrongdoing against @POTUS in the charges against Mr. Cohen. But in court, Cohen admitted that he made hush money payments to Stormy Daniels &amp; other women at the direction of @realdonaldtrump, to influence the election. #GUILTY #Resign'
