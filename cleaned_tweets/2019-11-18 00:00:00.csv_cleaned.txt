b'@realDonaldTrump The marvelous thing about your infantile whining and chest thumping is how sweet it will make your impeachment and imprisonment.'

b'@SixofB @noniphoto @sammk1964 @MatthewJshow @real_defender @realDonaldTrump Out of one face you demand higher taxes on the rich who make investments that make capitalism work. The other face bemoans the deficit. The deficit can only be cured with a better economy. Taxes suck investments off the street. Not buying leftist nonsense because it is nonsense'

b'@m_vogan @KarolRhodes13 @Kellydeer1 @lynnnysamusic @BJR3_Boston @realDonaldTrump @KatrinaPierson @SteveHiltonx In your world, only testimony supportive of Trump is reliable,  not partisan &amp; therefore credible. As a practical matter, that is the same thing as saying Trump is above the law. In America, people are not disregarded merely because they arent Trump loyalists.'
