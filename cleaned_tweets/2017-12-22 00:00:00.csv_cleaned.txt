b'@ericmarvel @realDonaldTrump You voted straight GOP, I\'d bet. Take a look at what the GOP introduced in Congress around December 14th. It\'s "entitlement reform", aka trying to take cut social security and take Medicare and turn it into a voucher program. Google it. Mom and GF are screwed. You voted for THAT!'
