b"@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump #1 hey nancy, Don't you think just over two years is a little long to be investigating an invented hoax?. it is a blatant attempt by you , the democrats, Clinton, to undermine the will of the voters when we elected Donald trump, using Mueller as your tool for treason."

b'@BethNickel2 @AlishaFruits @SebGorka @realDonaldTrump Then don\'t minimize the disaster that debt is by saying "its just moving money around". Also, since debt matters to you, its not "just moving money around". For every dollar of deficit, gov issues treasuries to pay for it. We pay interest on that which blows hole in fed budget'
b"@BOOKS116 @realDonaldTrump No, Trump will get the money from Mexico like he promised. Republicans didn't have enough votes 12 months ago to pass a bill like that, and they have even fewer votes today. Not a chance in hell."
