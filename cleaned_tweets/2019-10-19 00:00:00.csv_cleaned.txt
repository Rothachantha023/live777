b'@MACaVoyage @lucy4TRUMP2020 @glamelegance @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity I think at this juncture we need to give these locked up children back to their families &amp; send them back where they came from. I want us to be Americans again instead of fighting &amp; calling each other names. Let all those idiots in DC to do that.'

b'@realDonaldTrump Hey Donnie hows your Obamacare replacement coming? Hows the infrastructure deal coming? Hows the steal and coal industries coming. And finally hows your freaking trade wars comingyou remember the ones that would be easy to win. And you have the balls to call out Democrats.'
b"@realDonaldTrump You can't quote his walkback unless you also quote his confession otherwise he's a untrustworthy source"
b"@Loves_Animals1 @realDonaldTrump I'm sure they have Lori but it didnt take"
b"@realDonaldTrump That explanation isn't even internally consistent. If Trump thought Ukraine was too corrupt to give aid to, why would he want other nations to give aid to them? Furthermore, Congress appropriated the aid &amp; set anti-corruption procedure. Trump wasn't allowed to deny the aid."
b"@realDonaldTrump You haven't an honest bone in your body. Shut up already, we have had enough. Seriously."

b"@Aloanstar @seansogansta @newtnewtriot @TheGentleDonN @RealOmarNavarro @realDonaldTrump Sad. As a democrat, I'll own that the Dems haven't acknowledged the plight of many of those not living on the coasts. We are way overdue to change that. We need to unite as Americans and take care of each other."
