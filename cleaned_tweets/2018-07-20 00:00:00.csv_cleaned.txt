b'@VortexCyclone1 @berad_snyder @dhighl54 @realDonaldTrump I believe he said metaphorically kneel'
b'@realDonaldTrump I propose further penalties. Hand slips off heart during anthem, fifteen yards to begin the game. No hand on heart at all, four game suspension. Wrong hand on heart? Cut from the team and hand cut off. Hand on heart but no tears in eyes? $1 million fine &amp; three months jail time.'
b'@SassySulsa @Shawn92599648 @QuettaHusband @NewYorkPhotoGal @juangama5 @praer2000 @NatashaSawyers @ChrisEvans @realDonaldTrump I have. But to me, segregation and implimenting stricter travel laws for specific people is not "helping everyone". I\'m from the UK, I have an Iranian neighbour who used to visit family in the states. She can\'t anymore even though she is travelling from the UK.'

b'@realDonaldTrump If you dont know the difference between being firm &amp; strong, as apposed to being offensive and ill-mannered then youre not smart enough for the office.
