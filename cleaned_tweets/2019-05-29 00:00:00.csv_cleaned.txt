b'@MicheleChevere1 @SenSchumer @Top_Sergeant @realDonaldTrump said it best: I believe Putin #ComradeDonald #RussianPuppet https://t.co/j8T4B2rySv'
b'@realDonaldTrump &gt; Secondly, the case is NOT closed. In adherence to DOJ policy, Mueller has stated it is not his position to prosecute. It is UP TO CONGRESS. THEY WILL IMPEACH. Mueller DID NOT SAY you were innocent and/or exonerated from collusion/conspiracy and obstruction. Youre a criminal.'
b"@JeffLandry @realDonaldTrump Just pathetic. According to the DOJ congress should deal with this. Not a pathetic AG who doesn't know WTF he is talking about. Resign"
b'@JeffLandry @realDonaldTrump The issue isnt the quantum of evidence, its that DOJ policy forbids indicting a sitting president? Are you a Cooley grad or just naturally stupid? Did you read the report?'

b'@SenThomTillis @realDonaldTrump Can you read? What reading level did you achieve? Mueller did not clear Trump. He obstructed, he needs to be impeached. #IllegitimatePresident'
b'I commented on @realDonaldTrump tweet and received close to 500 negative responses. I blocked most of them. This indicates that I hit a nerve regarding Biden, and how people really do see him, and stating the obvious made them angry, because a part of them knows its true!'
