b'@LauraLoomer @sweetweetertot2 @greggutfeld @TheFive @realDonaldTrump I gotta agree here. Alex Jones is a butthead, and says a lot of things I dont agree with. However, once censorship begins, where does it end? If you dont like what he says, or what I say, just ignore it and find happier tweets to sooth your own soul. This isdangerous precedent'
