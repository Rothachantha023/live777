b"@realDonaldTrump so if there is nothing in the documents, hand them over and do damage control. You and your party are the ONLY ones making you look bad. Republican'ts are all making yourselves look guilty of every democrat suspicion."
b'@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Time to give America the truth. The coverup and stonewalling is ridiculous. Democracy and the Constitution are in process of being destroyed thanks to GOP. Youre working diligently to turn womens rights into the Handmaid Tale. Outrageous.'

b'@realDonaldTrump No. None of this is remotely so. Starting with you winning the election and everything going forward from there. Turns out, nothing before your stupid idea of running for president is true either. It was your vanity and greed that did you in. #TinyDancerPutinsTune'
b"@realDonaldTrump Its remarkable how the democratic party wasting America's time and taxpayers money harassing the people's American president. LET THE MAN DO HIS JOB"
