b'@NJ_2_FL @realDonaldTrump Yes I do believe we are screwed!'
b'@realDonaldTrump Another lie tariffs, do not create a magic treasury account. Daddy got robbed on your diplomas. Tariffs are paid by consumers, as a tax. Farmers are crippled by your moronic tariffs. Despite what your Mein Kampf bed time stories told you, repeating a lie, does not make it true.'

b"@jeremynewberger @realDonaldTrump China wants to stall and wait for 2020 in hopes for a Dem to deal with because it's easier to run roughshod over an Obama type that doesn't know how to negotiate because they never worked in the private sector"
b"@nickschadegg @AlexanderDowner @realDonaldTrump I agree Nicks comments are cringeworthy &amp; hopeless. However your original comment comparing PK to Donald Trump was pretty crazy and even worse given you're a former foreign minister. Surely you were just having a unguarded moment on Twitter and you really don't think that!!"

b"@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump So why are you trying get phase out ACA (Obamacare) without something to replace it. You don't care about healthcare except as propaganda for 2020. You want ACA repealed so US deficit caused by tax cuts to the wealthy can be reduced. #MAGA #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TheResistance"
b'@realDonaldTrump Everyone loves a bully... NOT!'

b'@realDonaldTrump So the tariffs have already cost jobs and could cause millions more. America is making millions from the American people instead of China now. The government may see some money, but the people dont because they pay for it in a different way. But people are buying his garbage.'
b'@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @RepJerryNadler @RepTedDeutch There is no law that says that a president cannot be indicted. It is only a DOJ policy based on a DOJ opinion, and arguably a very weak opinion in the view of many constitutional lawyers.'

b"@peteredawson @Brett_Berg @realDonaldTrump If the Democrats would've put up anyone besides Hillary they more than likely would have gotten my vote. Kind of shoots down your argument. Trump was best choice in 2016 and will be again in 2020, unless you're a Socialist?"
