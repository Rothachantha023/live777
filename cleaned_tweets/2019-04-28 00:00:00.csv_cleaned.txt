b'@SuperDLM515 @Amperdue17 @spendlove_ryan @7GenAmerican1 @ragtopgirl1 @bobinop @Bill_Shapiro @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You nailed it. Obama was a very decent and honorable man, but the racists freaked out over having a brown President and just went into an almost hyper lunacy phase. They feel that they are "losing America" if brown people are getting elected President. I have bad news for them.'
