b'@LouiseMensch @realDonaldTrump Remember that Trumps forefathers valiantly defended....their self interests in all conflict.'
b'@CLinJones13 @realDonaldTrump This is insanity. We are watching another genocide unfold. The Turks are bombing civilian areas without warning or reason. This will make Srebrenica look like a picnic.'
b'@joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump He sleeps great and its disgusting. https://t.co/IoIktf4aLe'
b'@realDonaldTrump His hardest thing is to not sound demented'
b'@realDonaldTrump And your tax returns are....whereabouts?You are a criminal, a despot, a two bit huckster and a disgrace to the very democracy that people fought and died for.'
b"@kclyle1 @meetbaII @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump I asked who the FISA was on, when it was issued &amp; by how many Dem judges? Meatball hasn't answered yet...probably doesn't know, just regurgitating RW talking points."

b'@realDonaldTrump The bar doesnt go low enough to match your wisdom!'
b"@gunhand12 @realDonaldTrump That is all just wrong. The House has the right and in certain instances, like impeachment, the Constitutional duty to perform oversight of the Executive Branch. Trump must comply. Obstruction of Congress is also an impeachable offense. see, Nixon's Article 3."
b'@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse ELECT A BETTER REALITY TV PERSONALITY VOTE KIM KARDASHIAN FOR PRESIDENT 2020 MORE DRAMA BETTER LOOKS FABULOUS HAIR'

b'@realDonaldTrump Youre lying again. Youre incompetent. Because of you innocent people in Turkey are being murdered!! You deserve to be impeached for NOT putting the US interests above your own greed.'
b'@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS GOP will cut their losses with Trump and have him resign. They need him out by 2020 to run a new ticket with Nikki Haley and a moderate white guy'
b'@realDonaldTrump This creep of a man makes everything about himself, even the suffering and grief of other people. He is incapable of empathy or compassion.'

b'@realDonaldTrump No. You are.'
b'@joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump Ambien !'
b'@McFaul @SteveKerr @realDonaldTrump thinks he is the United States. It is such an embarrassment to have Trump as the president of this great country. Enablers like @RepMarkMeadows behind Trump, have all contributed to making the US a mockery. Thanks Steve for speaking out against this clown!!'
b'@realDonaldTrump What does the UN do? Do they want the ISIS Prisoners?'
b'@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Jeff your shot please go back in your hole and remain there'
b'@USRepLong @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump Because intimidation works?'
b'@CNN Fair is having testimony behind closed doors, where GOP has no subpoena ability, where @realDonaldTrump has no lawyers representing him or ability to question the people giving testimony? Fairness is not giving the Americans who voted for him in 2016 ANY transparency??? '
b"@JenGriffinFNC @realDonaldTrump I fought alongside the Kurds and this is beyond disappointing &amp; heartbreaking. I support POTUS Trump against the Dems and Deep State, but I can't support the decision to abandon the Kurds. They stood by us and fought with us when Turkey would not."
