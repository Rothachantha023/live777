b"@kyblueblood .@SenatorCollins has burned so many bridges standing with @realDonaldTrump so many times, this is just a desperate ploy to get reelected. She is blood @GOP red through &amp; through &amp; one moment of clarity (is it?) doesn't wipe away years of sticking it to America. Class A phony."
b'@realDonaldTrump MSM is not an honest broker worthy of American trust. The trust is gone until a new system of objective information is built.'
b'@realDonaldTrump That is not but violating the law as you did is. How many Americans have to have 2-3 jobs just to get by today ? Is that what you are really tryin got brag about ?'

b'@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Come on Winners , Get the $$ out &amp; help our President &amp; Conservatives/Republicans WIN. We need to show Pelosi Schiff &amp; Schumer, that we dont appreciate their antics. AND SHE needs to wake up or she may lose her Great paying Job, for thinking she is #1.'
b'@realDonaldTrump Boy, are you dumb. This has nothing to do with your dirty tricks. Separate the twodaily responsibility and shady, personal business deals. Then you will discover impeachable events. '
b'@DrPhalanx @realDonaldTrump @60Minutes But he screwed over you son to start with...socialism at its finest!'
b'@realDonaldTrump I believe its all the crimes youve committed that are the impeachable offenses. This is country of laws, not some Orange Republic.'
b'@realDonaldTrump @WSJatLarge Thats because it doesnt include all the women youve sexually assaulted, raped, used Mar-A-Lago for Epsteins sex trafficking ring and your new Chinese sex trafficker. All Starr was dealing with was consensual sex.'
b'@gtconway3d @realDonaldTrump Stain is already there no matter what he does'
b'@realDonaldTrump @WSJatLarge https://t.co/SBUdfVUsfK'
b'@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes Btw, Chuck Grassley is cashing those #welfare checks too.'
b'@big_t1981 @logisticsxpert @realDonaldTrump Give me the investigation results that incriminate Biden or else you will not get the military aid or a trip to meet the President. They need to meet with Trump to show that the U.S. backs the Ukraine against Russian invasion. Quid pro quo is exactly what happened.'
b'@TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow The obama administration investigated Trump for three years? Are we into time travel again? And you spelled public servant wrong. Trump should try being one sometime.'
b'@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes Taxpayers are paying for this bullshit.'
b'@Snapphanare @realDonaldTrump You might want to read the rest there is more than Article 2. There are conditions that need to be met. He did not meet them. He was not looking specifically for corruption and he made that clear the first couple days.'
b'@DogginTrump @realDonaldTrump You wish that garbage was true but its clearly not. If he actually did anything to steal the election, he would no longer be president. And he is. Thank God for that.'
b'@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes This is another lie!'
b'@JoeySalads @realDonaldTrump Even if the "swamp is drained" the cesspool will remain at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue until Nov. 2020. Meanwhile, America can watch an impeachment in the House &amp; an acquittal in the Senate while problems like gun regulation, prescription drug prices, &amp; infrastructure remain....'
b'@realDonaldTrump No'
b"@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes You can't still believe that"
b'@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump As your party sinks lower and lower..... https://t.co/uu7xjqUeBg'
b'@realDonaldTrump Hey! People are working 2 and 3 jobs and STILL cant make ends meet...this is not a positive outcome....'
b"@realDonaldTrump @WSJatLarge Donnie, you are just blind, stubborn and stupid... of course you don't see it. Just like you didn't want to see that your Dad's tax fraud-sourced money was what started you on this dark, corrupt path. Sad...very sad."
b'@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes @realDonaldTrump You shouldnt have time to watch this much TV. Do your job.'
b"@realDonaldTrump Mr. President,what I would do is ask A.G.Barr to assign a special prosecutor to the Ukranian/ Biden Situation.Have this guy investigate both sides. U didn't do anything illegal or corrupt so you dont have to worry but this will have the deep state &amp; fake media dropping brisks"
