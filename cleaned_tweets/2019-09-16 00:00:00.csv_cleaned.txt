b'@patrick_edmonds @ProzackPH7 @Toby51225250 @AndrewYang "Progressives" ignoring "Racists" is one of the things that got @realDonaldTrump elected in the 1st place, so @AndrewYang\'s approach is good because those are the people we need to educate and convert. Cutting them off will just cause them to double down.'
b"@realDonaldTrump I'm glad you have your eye on what's really important right now. "
